# Map files begin with map keyword to signify the start of the map object.
# Well, the entire map file is THE map object.  Enclose between MAP and END 
# at the very bottom of this map file, are keyword/value pairs and other

  # The projection object is typically used within the map and the layer 
  # objects. You only define it once within the map object and this definition 
  # becomes your output projection--MapServer will render your maps in this
  # projection.  You also use the projection object within the layer object to
  # define your input projection.  Your layers can be in different 
  # projections--MapServer will reproject them into your output projection.
  # If no projection is defined within the layer object, MapServer assumes 
  # your input projection is the same as your output projection.  This is not
  # a required object unless you're creating a map file that supports one of 
  # the OGC interoperability web services specifications (WMS/WFS/WCS).

  # Layer objects, too, are defined beneath the map object.  Be mindful of the

  # order--that is, the last layer you define (at the bottom of the map file) 
  # will be drawn on top and the first layer you define (right after this 
  # comment), will be drawn at the bottom.  Here's my rule: rasters and 
  # polygons are defined first, followed by the line layers. The point and 
  # annotation layers are defined last.  You can play around with the ordering 
  # of your layers until you're satisfied.
