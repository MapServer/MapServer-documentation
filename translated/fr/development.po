"MapBuilder, and GRASS decided immediately to participate in the foundation."

"OSGeo provides a unique and necessary structure for the MapServer project to"
" solve some of the issues an Open Source project by itself cannot.  One of "

"solicitation of sponsorship, and more formal project organization.  While "
"the MapServer project has done some of these things by itself in some form "
"over the years, a formalized structure that has its mission to do so "

"The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo for short, will seek to "
"provide roughly the same kind of function for the F/OSS GIS community that "
"the Apache Software Foundation provides for the Apache development and user "
"communities, with the primary difference being that, where Apache started as"
" a single project and then branched out, the OSGeo Foundation is attempting "
"to weld together the overlapping but sometimes disparate interests of "
"different projects with different communities. The Foundation will hopefully"
" serve as an outreach and advocacy organization for the community; a forum "
"for improving cross-project collaboration; a unified professional front for "
"large government and corporate users; a source of shared infrastructure, "
"like code and documentation repositories; and as a legal entity to help "
"protect developers and users of Open Source geospatial software against "
"greedy patent lawsuits or unscrupulous license infringements. In general, "
"the object of the Foundation will be, in the words of Mark Lucas of OSSIM, "
"to \"help us do what we love\" -- which, for most of us, is building useful "
"tools for digital cartography and geospatial analysis, and solving "
"interesting problems with them."

"According to :ref:`MS RFC 25 <rfc25>` \"MapServer uses different pixel and "

"uses the center of a pixel to represent its unique coordinate value. An "
"extent is interpreted as the bounding box that runs from the center of the "
"UL pixel in an image to the center of the LR pixel in an image. Why? Well, "
"it goes back to companion software that existed along side MapServer to "
"display satellite data stored in ERDAS that used the center to center extent"

"By this time the core MapServer code has become widely used by many of the "
"different application models. The extended usage of MapScript causes the "
"possibility that the execution of the code is carried out by multiple "
"threads, standing a fair chance portions of the code being called by the "
"different threads simultaneously. The threading model of the application may"
" fall beyond the control of the MapServer code, at the worst case even the "
"host process of the application is beyond the programmer's scope. For "
"example a web mapping application may be executed by a pre-existing host "
"process ensuring to serve the user requests and calling the MapServer code "
"by different threads from a pool of threads. The usage of process-wide "
"global variables and resources within MapServer may require the need to "
"serialize of the access to the variable by the multiple threads by using "
"locks. The current approach uses process-wide locks to ensure the safe "
"access to these variables causing performance degradation in multithreaded "
"environments. Currently this behavior may be controlled by the USE_THREAD "
"compilation switch."

"This is where things get interesting. I'm proposing adding a new query, "

" an extent parameter. Drivers like shapefiles still need to first apply a "

"to combine the extent and expression string (more likely the tokens) if they"
" so choose. msQueryByFilter() works much like msQueryByAttributes(). The "
