In 6.2, there is no label allocated in the class object by default and your MapScript code (python, etc.) has to create new label objects and add them to the class object. Three new methods were added to the `classObj` in MapScript to handle this: ``getLabel``, ``addLabel``, ``removeLabel``.

msgid "The OSGeo bootstrap meeting of February 4th, 2006 was attended by Steve Lime, Frank Warmerdam, Pericles Nacionales, Howard Butler, Tom Burk, Dave McIlhagga and others from the MapServer community.  By their participation in this meeting, these individuals are part of the initial group of members in the OSGeo foundation.  A thorough, thoughtful, and stimulating discussion about how the OSGeo foundation can help to alleviate issues that an individual project cannot overcome took place.  Many projects that were represented at the meeting, including GDAL, OSSIM, MapGuide Open Source, MapBuilder, and GRASS decided immediately to participate in the foundation.  The folks represented by MapServer at the meeting stated that they would also like to participate, contingent on approval by both the MTSC and the community at large."

msgid "OSGeo provides a unique and necessary structure for the MapServer project to solve some of the issues an Open Source project by itself cannot.  One of the most important ones is the idea of an umbrella organization that can take on issues like infrastructure, branding and visibility, outreach, solicitation of sponsorship, and more formal project organization.  While the MapServer project has done some of these things by itself in some form over the years, a formalized structure that has its mission to do so provides a more attractive solution. Here are some expected benefits, described by `Schuyler Erle`_, who also attended the meeting:"

msgid "The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo for short, will seek to provide roughly the same kind of function for the F/OSS GIS community that the Apache Software Foundation provides for the Apache development and user communities, with the primary difference being that, where Apache started as a single project and then branched out, the OSGeo Foundation is attempting to weld together the overlapping but sometimes disparate interests of different projects with different communities. The Foundation will hopefully serve as an outreach and advocacy organization for the community; a forum for improving cross-project collaboration; a unified professional front for large government and corporate users; a source of shared infrastructure, like code and documentation repositories; and as a legal entity to help protect developers and users of Open Source geospatial software against greedy patent lawsuits or unscrupulous license infringements. In general, the object of the Foundation will be, in the words of Mark Lucas of OSSIM, to \"help us do what we love\" -- which, for most of us, is building useful tools for digital cartography and geospatial analysis, and solving interesting problems with them."

In this case we propose that the MTSC go through its decision process, and if approved, the community will be solicited to provide their input via a non-anonymous website poll.

msgid "By this time the core MapServer code has become widely used by many of the different application models. The extended usage of MapScript causes the possibility that the execution of the code is carried out by multiple threads, standing a fair chance portions of the code being called by the different threads simultaneously. The threading model of the application may fall beyond the control of the MapServer code, at the worst case even the host process of the application is beyond the programmer's scope. For example a web mapping application may be executed by a pre-existing host process ensuring to serve the user requests and calling the MapServer code by different threads from a pool of threads. The usage of process-wide global variables and resources within MapServer may require the need to serialize of the access to the variable by the multiple threads by using locks. The current approach uses process-wide locks to ensure the safe access to these variables causing performance degradation in multithreaded environments. Currently this behavior may be controlled by the USE_THREAD compilation switch."

msgid "Currently the various query operations involve multiple accesses to the data providers which may cause a significant performance impact depending on the providers. In the first phase all of the features in the given search area are retrieved and the index of the relevant shapes are stored in the result cache. In the second phase the features in the result cache are retrieved form the provider one by one. Retaining the shapes in the memory we could eliminate the need of the subsequent accesses to the providers and increase the overall performance of the query. Implementing the cache requires a transformation of the data between the data provider and the client. From this aspect it is desirable to provide a framework to implement this transformation in a higher level of abstraction."

An extent is interpreted as the bounding box that runs from the center of the UL pixel in an image to the center of the LR pixel in an image. Why? Well, it goes back to companion software that existed along side MapServer to display satellite data stored in ERDAS that used the center to center extent model. The math is simple and there is a certain logic in having the extent actually represent pixel values - that is, if you render the extent as a polygon you get the exact edge of the image as one might expect."

That does add complexity to the map <=> image coordinate transformations since you have to offset things by one-half cellsize. Since that computation is done many times I would expect a performance hit. We could optimize things by computing and storing the one-half cellsize value once (as cellsize is now), but that complicates the C APIs and requires huge amounts of change. I propose moving to a upper-left-based pixel model to simplify these conversions."

On the other hand, AGG does not have built in functions to read or write popular graphics formats such as GIF, JPEG or PNG. It makes sense then to consider a hybrid solution wherein we can take advantage of aspects of GD that make sense such as buffer management and I/O capabilities, and let AGG worry about rendering features. That's exactly what is proposed- AGG rendering into a GD managed image buffer. A secondary benefit is that AGG functionality can be added incrementally as time and resources permit. For example, since an AGG imageObj is really just a gdImagePtr we can use current code that renders to a GD image along side any AGG routines."

msgid ":ref:`rfc31` introduced a new syntax for modifying :ref:`mapfiles <mapfile>` via URL. Object parameters could specified together in mapfile snippets making it easier to make changes with far fewer characters. At the same time access to a number of parameters, particularly those that mapfile parsing did no value checks on (mostly strings) were removed for security purposes. In hindsight I underestimated the degree to which that functionality was used by developers. This RFC aims to restore that functionality albeit with security in mind."

msgid "Presently a few widely modified (and risky) parameters (e.g. layer TEMPLATE and DATA) can be changed via URL **if** a regular expression (e.g. TEMPLATEPATTERN and DATAPATTERN) is set to validate the incoming value. I propose using the same approach for all un-checked mapfile input. Parameters that represent numbers, colors or have a value domain (e.g. ON/OFF/DEFAULT) are subject to the same checks as when a mapfile is read from disk and as a result should be ok. Those that don't would require specific validation values be set before input would be allowed. For example, the LAYER VALIDATION block below defines patterns that would be used to validate DATA or FILTER parameter changes. If the appropriate validation key doesn't exist the value cannot change."

msgid "Grouping all validation in a new VALIDATION block will ease use by simplifying key names to match MapServer token names. The block would be valid for :ref:`MAP`, :ref:`WEB`, :ref:`LAYER` and :ref:`CLASS` objects and its core type would be a hashTableObj. The MAP level VALIDATION block would be useful for applying a pattern for all LAYERs or CLASSes (since there is only 1 WEB object there is no need to rely on the MAP object). This would save lots of duplication in cases where a mapfile contains similar layers and the same data validation pattern applies to all. The logic would simply be: look for validation pattern in layer, if not found then look for validation pattern at map level, if not found then no modifications are allowed."

Other drivers could choose to combine the extent and expression string (more likely the tokens) if they so choose. msQueryByFilter() works much like msQueryByAttributes(). The layer API has been extended to include a prototype, msLayerSupportsCommonFilters(), that allows the driver to say if it could process this common expression format natively somehow (e.g. via a FILTER and msLayerWhichShapes()/ msLayerNextShape()) or if the expression would need to be applied after msLayerNextShape() is called repeatedly. The shapefile and tiled shapefile drivers would work natively, as would any driver that uses msEvalExpression().

With an upgrade of wms_layer_group functionality to use Group parameter to indicate the level of the XPath expression that can be requested (refer to http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/1632), and the addition of the functionality discussed in this RFC, the user will have flexibility to configure the map file to show/hide low level layers and to allow or not WMS requests at different levels of the tree hierarchy.  This is especially important to be able to support the INSPIRE requirements."

We could then use this single layer in the same way as any other layer when setting up the classes styles and labels.

Currently there's no such mechanism in MapServer which would prevent from the symbols to overlap based on their relative locations. In a feasible solution we should provide rendering the isolated symbols as is, but create new (clustered) features for those symbols that would overlap in a particular scale. According to the example at http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/attachment/ticket/3700/cluster.png the number of the features forming the clusters are displayed in the labels for each clustered features."

msgid "This unit testing framework only covers functionality that is exposed to the Python mapscript module. It can help to check on pieces of the core MapServer code, but is no guarantor of the :ref:`mapserv` program or of the :ref:`PHP MapScript <php_mapscript>` module. As of this writing, there are 159 tests in the suite.  These are tests of features added since mid-2003. Much of MapServer's older stuff remains untested and it is doubtful that we'll make the time to go back and fill in."
