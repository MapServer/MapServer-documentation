msgid "Alter the precision with which colors need to match an entry in the color table to use it when producing 8bit colormapped output (IMAGEMODE PC256). Normally colors from a raster colormap (or greyscale values) need to match exactly. This relaxes the requirement to being within the specified color distance. So a COLOR_MATCH_THRESHOLD of 3 would mean that an existing color entry within 3 (sum of difference in red, green and blue) would be used instead of creating a new colormap entry. Especially with greyscale raster layers, which would normally use all 256 color entries if available, this can be a good way to avoid \"stealing\" your whole colormap for a raster layer. Normally values in the range 2-6 will give good results."
