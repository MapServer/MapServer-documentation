The first version of the document was based on the results of a project carried out at the University of Hannover, Institute of Landscape and Nature Conservation. It was initiated by Mr. Dipl. Ing. Roland Hachmann. Parts have been taken from a study carried through by Karsten Hoffmann, student of Geography and Cartography at the FU Berlin. In the context of a hands-on training in the company GraS GmbH Mr. Hoffman mainly dealed with the development of symbols.  (`Download study report`_ in German) His degree dissertation will also concern this subject."

A polygon data set can be rendered as lines to frame the polygons with a line signature.  It can also be rendred as polygons with a symbol filling the polygon.  When the polygon fill is rendered on top of the lines, the inner part of the underlying outline is covered by the fill symbol of the polygon.  What is observed here is a clipping effect tha in will result in an asymmetric symbol for the boundary line.
