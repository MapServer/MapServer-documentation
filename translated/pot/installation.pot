To make it easy for users and developers, I've made a list of steps to compile MapServer. Background information is provided in each step, along with examples.

For those who are antsy, compiling MapServer involves download and unpacking the source codes, editing the make files, and invoking Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler from the command prompt.
