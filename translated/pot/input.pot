This is called a 'TILEINDEX' and works similarly to the same feature in vector layers.

Normally colors from a raster colormap (or greyscale values) need to match exactly. This relaxes the requirement to being within the specified color distance. So a COLOR_MATCH_THRESHOLD of 3 would mean that an existing color entry within 3 (sum of difference in red, green and blue) would be used instead of creating a new colormap entry. Especially with greyscale raster layers, which would normally use all 256 color entries if available, this can be a good way to avoid \"stealing\" your whole colormap for a raster layer. Normally values in the range 2-6 will give good results."

In vector data, the basic units of spatial information are points, lines and polygons.  Each of these units is composed simply as a series of one or more coordinate points. For example, a line is a collection of related points, and a polygon is a collection of related lines.  Vector images are defined mathematically as a series of points joined by lines.  Vector-based drawings are resolution independent.  This means that they appear at the maximum resolution of the output device, such as a printer or monitor.  Each object is self-contained, with properties such as color, shape, outline, size, and position on the screen.\""
