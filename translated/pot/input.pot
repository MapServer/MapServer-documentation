In an area all one color in the source image, a variety of output pixel colors would be selected such that the average of the pixels would more closely approximate the desired color. Dithering also takes advantage of all currently allocated colors, not just those in the color cube. Dithering requires GDAL 1.1.9 or later, and is enabled by providing the `PROCESSING` \"DITHER=YES\" option in the mapfile.

Normally colors from a raster colormap (or greyscale values) need to match exactly. This relaxes the requirement to being within the specified color distance. So a COLOR_MATCH_THRESHOLD of 3 would mean that an existing color entry within 3 (sum of difference in red, green and blue) would be used instead of creating a new colormap entry. Especially with greyscale raster layers, which would normally use all 256 color entries if available, this can be a good way to avoid \"stealing\" your whole colormap for a raster layer. Normally values in the range 2-6 will give good results."

In vector data, the basic units of spatial information are points, lines and polygons.  Each of these units is composed simply as a series of one or more coordinate points. For example, a line is a collection of related points, and a polygon is a collection of related lines.  Vector images are defined mathematically as a series of points joined by lines.  Vector-based drawings are resolution independent.  This means that they appear at the maximum resolution of the output device, such as a printer or monitor.  Each object is self-contained, with properties such as color, shape, outline, size, and position on the screen.\""
