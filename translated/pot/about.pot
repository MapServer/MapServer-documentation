msgid "MapServer is an `Open Source`_ geographic data rendering engine written in C. Beyond browsing GIS data, MapServer allows you create \"geographic image maps\", that is, maps that can direct users to content. For example, the Minnesota DNR `Recreation Compass <http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/compass.html>`__ provides users with more than 10,000 web pages, reports and maps via a single application. The same application serves as a \"map engine\" for other portions of the site, providing spatial context where needed."
