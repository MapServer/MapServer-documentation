A thorough, thoughtful, and stimulating discussion about how the OSGeo foundation can help to alleviate issues that an individual project cannot overcome took place.  Many projects that were represented at the meeting, including GDAL, OSSIM, MapGuide Open Source, MapBuilder, and GRASS decided immediately to participate in the foundation.

While the MapServer project has done some of these things by itself in some form over the years, a formalized structure that has its mission to do so provides a more attractive solution. Here are some expected benefits, described by `Schuyler Erle`_, who also attended the meeting:"

The Foundation will hopefully serve as an outreach and advocacy organization for the community; a forum for improving cross-project collaboration; a unified professional front for large government and corporate users; a source of shared infrastructure, like code and documentation repositories; and as a legal entity to help protect developers and users of Open Source geospatial software against greedy patent lawsuits or unscrupulous license infringements. In general, the object of the Foundation will be, in the words of Mark Lucas of OSSIM, to \"help us do what we love\" -- which, for most of us, is building useful tools for digital cartography and geospatial analysis, and solving interesting problems with them."

msgid "By this time the core MapServer code has become widely used by many of the different application models. The extended usage of MapScript causes the possibility that the execution of the code is carried out by multiple threads, standing a fair chance portions of the code being called by the different threads simultaneously. The threading model of the application may fall beyond the control of the MapServer code, at the worst case even the host process of the application is beyond the programmer's scope. For example a web mapping application may be executed by a pre-existing host process ensuring to serve the user requests and calling the MapServer code by different threads from a pool of threads. The usage of process-wide global variables and resources within MapServer may require the need to serialize of the access to the variable by the multiple threads by using locks. The current approach uses process-wide locks to ensure the safe access to these variables causing performance degradation in multithreaded environments. Currently this behavior may be controlled by the USE_THREAD compilation switch."

In the first phase all of the features in the given search area are retrieved and the index of the relevant shapes are stored in the result cache. In the second phase the features in the result cache are retrieved form the provider one by one. Retaining the shapes in the memory we could eliminate the need of the subsequent accesses to the providers and increase the overall performance of the query. Implementing the cache requires a transformation of the data between the data provider and the client.

An extent is interpreted as the bounding box that runs from the center of the UL pixel in an image to the center of the LR pixel in an image. Why? Well, it goes back to companion software that existed along side MapServer to display satellite data stored in ERDAS that used the center to center extent model. The math is simple and there is a certain logic in having the extent actually represent pixel values - that is, if you render the extent as a polygon you get the exact edge of the image as one might expect."

Since that computation is done many times I would expect a performance hit.

Rule of thumb one: when there is the opportunity for more than one of a particular object (e.g. layers, classes and styles) the syntax must uniquely identify the object in question in the variable name (e.g. map.layer[lakes]) and then the mapfile snippet to modify the object is given as the variable value. We have no way to modify 5 styles at once because the mapfile syntax is so freeform. Rule of thumb two: any parameters or objects that hang off the mapObj must be referenced in the variable name (e.g. map.imagetype)."

On the other hand, AGG does not have built in functions to read or write popular graphics formats such as GIF, JPEG or PNG. It makes sense then to consider a hybrid solution wherein we can take advantage of aspects of GD that make sense such as buffer management and I/O capabilities, and let AGG worry about rendering features. That's exactly what is proposed- AGG rendering into a GD managed image buffer. A secondary benefit is that AGG functionality can be added incrementally as time and resources permit. For example, since an AGG imageObj is really just a gdImagePtr we can use current code that renders to a GD image along side any AGG routines."

msgid ":ref:`rfc31` introduced a new syntax for modifying :ref:`mapfiles <mapfile>` via URL. Object parameters could specified together in mapfile snippets making it easier to make changes with far fewer characters. At the same time access to a number of parameters, particularly those that mapfile parsing did no value checks on (mostly strings) were removed for security purposes. In hindsight I underestimated the degree to which that functionality was used by developers. This RFC aims to restore that functionality albeit with security in mind."

I propose using the same approach for all un-checked mapfile input. Parameters that represent numbers, colors or have a value domain (e.g. ON/OFF/DEFAULT) are subject to the same checks as when a mapfile is read from disk and as a result should be ok. Those that don't would require specific validation values be set before input would be allowed. For example, the LAYER VALIDATION block below defines patterns that would be used to validate DATA or FILTER parameter changes. If the appropriate validation key doesn't exist the value cannot change."

The block would be valid for :ref:`MAP`, :ref:`WEB`, :ref:`LAYER` and :ref:`CLASS` objects and its core type would be a hashTableObj. The MAP level VALIDATION block would be useful for applying a pattern for all LAYERs or CLASSes (since there is only 1 WEB object there is no need to rely on the MAP object). This would save lots of duplication in cases where a mapfile contains similar layers and the same data validation pattern applies to all.

This works by caching a list of feature IDs (pass one) and then a second pass through the features for presentation: templated output, drawing, or retrieval via MapScript. The obvious problem is the performance hit incurred from the second pass. The real pain is that the msLayerGetShape() function, as implemented, provides random access to the data which can be very expensive for certain drivers."

Other drivers could choose to combine the extent and expression string (more likely the tokens) if they so choose. msQueryByFilter() works much like msQueryByAttributes(). The layer API has been extended to include a prototype, msLayerSupportsCommonFilters(), that allows the driver to say if it could process this common expression format natively somehow (e.g. via a FILTER and msLayerWhichShapes()/ msLayerNextShape()) or if the expression would need to be applied after msLayerNextShape() is called repeatedly. The shapefile and tiled shapefile drivers would work natively, as would any driver that uses msEvalExpression().

One limitation of libexempi (and all other XMP libraries we investigated) is that it only works on existing files. That means that any image that is going to be tagged with metadata must be written to the disk first. Fortunately the GDAL image driver already writes a temporary file to disk for every request, so we propose that XMP support be available only when using the GDAL output format driver."

msgid "While SVN suits our needs as a collaborative source code versionner, it has  shortcomings that make it difficult to work with for developpers working on multiple tasks in parallel. Git's easy branching makes it possible to set up branches for individual task, isolating code changes from other branches, thus making the switch from one task to another possible without the risk of loosing or erroneously commiting work-in-progress code. Three-way merging of different branches means that merging code from one branch to another becomes a rapid task, by only having to deal with actual conflicts in the code. Offline committing and access to entire history make working offline possible."

Much of MapServer's older stuff remains untested and it is doubtful that we'll make the time to go back and fill in."
