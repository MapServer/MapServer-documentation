In 6.2, there is no label allocated in the class object by default and your MapScript code (python, etc.) has to create new label objects and add them to the class object. Three new methods were added to the `classObj` in MapScript to handle this: ``getLabel``, ``addLabel``, ``removeLabel``.

A thorough, thoughtful, and stimulating discussion about how the OSGeo foundation can help to alleviate issues that an individual project cannot overcome took place.  Many projects that were represented at the meeting, including GDAL, OSSIM, MapGuide Open Source, MapBuilder, and GRASS decided immediately to participate in the foundation.

While the MapServer project has done some of these things by itself in some form over the years, a formalized structure that has its mission to do so provides a more attractive solution.

The Foundation will hopefully serve as an outreach and advocacy organization for the community; a forum for improving cross-project collaboration; a unified professional front for large government and corporate users; a source of shared infrastructure, like code and documentation repositories; and as a legal entity to help protect developers and users of Open Source geospatial software against greedy patent lawsuits or unscrupulous license infringements. In general, the object of the Foundation will be, in the words of Mark Lucas of OSSIM, to \"help us do what we love\" -- which, for most of us, is building useful tools for digital cartography and geospatial analysis, and solving interesting problems with them."

msgid "By this time the core MapServer code has become widely used by many of the different application models. The extended usage of MapScript causes the possibility that the execution of the code is carried out by multiple threads, standing a fair chance portions of the code being called by the different threads simultaneously. The threading model of the application may fall beyond the control of the MapServer code, at the worst case even the host process of the application is beyond the programmer's scope. For example a web mapping application may be executed by a pre-existing host process ensuring to serve the user requests and calling the MapServer code by different threads from a pool of threads. The usage of process-wide global variables and resources within MapServer may require the need to serialize of the access to the variable by the multiple threads by using locks. The current approach uses process-wide locks to ensure the safe access to these variables causing performance degradation in multithreaded environments. Currently this behavior may be controlled by the USE_THREAD compilation switch."

msgid "Currently the various query operations involve multiple accesses to the data providers which may cause a significant performance impact depending on the providers. In the first phase all of the features in the given search area are retrieved and the index of the relevant shapes are stored in the result cache. In the second phase the features in the result cache are retrieved form the provider one by one. Retaining the shapes in the memory we could eliminate the need of the subsequent accesses to the providers and increase the overall performance of the query. Implementing the cache requires a transformation of the data between the data provider and the client. From this aspect it is desirable to provide a framework to implement this transformation in a higher level of abstraction."

An extent is interpreted as the bounding box that runs from the center of the UL pixel in an image to the center of the LR pixel in an image. Why? Well, it goes back to companion software that existed along side MapServer to display satellite data stored in ERDAS that used the center to center extent model. The math is simple and there is a certain logic in having the extent actually represent pixel values - that is, if you render the extent as a polygon you get the exact edge of the image as one might expect."

Since that computation is done many times I would expect a performance hit. We could optimize things by computing and storing the one-half cellsize value once (as cellsize is now), but that complicates the C APIs and requires huge amounts of change.

On the other hand, AGG does not have built in functions to read or write popular graphics formats such as GIF, JPEG or PNG. It makes sense then to consider a hybrid solution wherein we can take advantage of aspects of GD that make sense such as buffer management and I/O capabilities, and let AGG worry about rendering features. That's exactly what is proposed- AGG rendering into a GD managed image buffer. A secondary benefit is that AGG functionality can be added incrementally as time and resources permit. For example, since an AGG imageObj is really just a gdImagePtr we can use current code that renders to a GD image along side any AGG routines."

msgid ":ref:`rfc31` introduced a new syntax for modifying :ref:`mapfiles <mapfile>` via URL. Object parameters could specified together in mapfile snippets making it easier to make changes with far fewer characters. At the same time access to a number of parameters, particularly those that mapfile parsing did no value checks on (mostly strings) were removed for security purposes. In hindsight I underestimated the degree to which that functionality was used by developers. This RFC aims to restore that functionality albeit with security in mind."

I propose using the same approach for all un-checked mapfile input. Parameters that represent numbers, colors or have a value domain (e.g. ON/OFF/DEFAULT) are subject to the same checks as when a mapfile is read from disk and as a result should be ok. Those that don't would require specific validation values be set before input would be allowed. For example, the LAYER VALIDATION block below defines patterns that would be used to validate DATA or FILTER parameter changes. If the appropriate validation key doesn't exist the value cannot change."

The block would be valid for :ref:`MAP`, :ref:`WEB`, :ref:`LAYER` and :ref:`CLASS` objects and its core type would be a hashTableObj. The MAP level VALIDATION block would be useful for applying a pattern for all LAYERs or CLASSes (since there is only 1 WEB object there is no need to rely on the MAP object). This would save lots of duplication in cases where a mapfile contains similar layers and the same data validation pattern applies to all. The logic would simply be: look for validation pattern in layer, if not found then look for validation pattern at map level, if not found then no modifications are allowed."

Setting map.resolution to a higher value ensures that the layers minscaledenom/maxscaledenom are properly evaluated for the larger image, but one thing is missing: symbology (line widths, symbol and font sizes, etc) is not adjusted to reflect the resolution change and the result is a map in which symbology looks smaller than what it looked on screen."

The reason they provide variable binding is to prevent needing to resolve data-type issues in the SQL and it prevent SQL injection.  Various MapServer applications take untrusted user input from the CGI request and insert it into an SQL statement.  This leaves an open vector for SQL injection.  This also causes some issues as SQL requires properly escaping strings and integers.  Not having to know that ahead of time is useful."

Other drivers could choose to combine the extent and expression string (more likely the tokens) if they so choose. msQueryByFilter() works much like msQueryByAttributes(). The layer API has been extended to include a prototype, msLayerSupportsCommonFilters(), that allows the driver to say if it could process this common expression format natively somehow (e.g. via a FILTER and msLayerWhichShapes()/ msLayerNextShape()) or if the expression would need to be applied after msLayerNextShape() is called repeatedly. The shapefile and tiled shapefile drivers would work natively, as would any driver that uses msEvalExpression().

In theory, it might be nice to be able to have multiple source layers that have similar attributes and to be able to combine them into a single layer (being called as union layer) using some compatible subset of the source column attributes so that the combined layer could be treated as a single layer. We could then use this single layer in the same way as any other layer when setting up the classes styles and labels. This layer could also provide the option to use features from multiple layers when configuring clustering support as per :ref:`MS RFC 69 <rfc69>`."

It can help to check on pieces of the core MapServer code, but is no guarantor of the :ref:`mapserv` program or of the :ref:`PHP MapScript <php_mapscript>` module. As of this writing, there are 159 tests in the suite.  These are tests of features added since mid-2003. Much of MapServer's older stuff remains untested and it is doubtful that we'll make the time to go back and fill in."
