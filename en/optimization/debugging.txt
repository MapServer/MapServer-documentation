Introduction
============

When developing an application for the Internet, you will inevitably across problems many problems 
in your environment.  The goal of this guide is to assist you with locating the problem
with your MapServer application.

- :ref:`MapServer Errors <errors>`

Steps to Enable MapServer Debugging
===================================

Starting with MapServer 5.0, you are able to control the levels of debugging/logging
information returned to you by MapServer, and also control the location of the output
log file.

In technical terms, there are msDebug() calls in various areas of the MapServer code that generate 
information that may be useful in tuning and troubleshooting applications.

Step 1: Set the MS_ERRORFILE Variable
-------------------------------------

The **MS_ERRORFILE** variable is used to specify the output of debug messages from MapServer.  
You can pass the following values to **MS_ERRORFILE**:

**[filename]**
  Full path and filename of a log file, to contain MapServer's debug messages.  Any file extension
  can be used, but *.log* or *.txt* is recommended.  The file will be created, if it does not 
  already exist.

  Starting with MapServer 6.0, a filename with relative path can be passed 
  via the CONFIG MS_ERRORFILE directive, in which case the filename is 
  relative to the mapfile location. Note that setting MS_ERRORFILE via an 
  environment variable always requires an absolute path since there would 
  be no mapfile to make the path relative to.
  
**stderr**
  Use this to send MapServer's debug messages to the Web server's log file (i.e. "standard error"). 
  If you are using Apache, your debug messages will be placed in the Apache  *error_log* file. 
  If you are using Microsoft IIS, your debug messages will be sent to *stdout*
  (i.e. the browser), so its use is discouraged. With IIS it is recommended to direct output to a file
  instead.
  
**stdout**
  Use this to send MapServer's debug messages to the standard output (i.e. the browser), combined with 
  the rest of MapServer's output.
  
**windowsdebug**
  Use this to send MapServer's debug messages to the Windows OutputDebugString API, allowing the use of 
  external programs like SysInternals debugview to display the debug output.


Through the Mapfile
*******************

The recommended way to set the **MS_ERRORFILE** variable is in your mapfile, within the :ref:`MAP` object, 
such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END

Through an Environment Variable
*******************************

You can also set the **MS_ERRORFILE** variable as an environment variable on your system.  Apache
users can set the environment variable in Apache's *httpd.conf* file, such as:

::

   SetEnv MS_ERRORFILE "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"

Windows users can alternatively set the environment variable through the Windows System 
Properties; but make sure to set a SYSTEM environment variable.
   
.. NOTE::
   If both the *MS_ERRORFILE* environment variable is set and a *CONFIG MS_ERRORFILE* is also set, 
   then the CONFIG directive takes precedence.

Step 2: Set the DEBUG Level
---------------------------

You can retrieve varying types of debug messages by setting the *DEBUG* parameter in the :ref:`mapfile`.  
You can place the *DEBUG* parameter in any LAYER in the mapfile, or instead, set it once in the MAP
object so that it applies to each layer.  Use the value of the *DEBUG* parameter to set the type of information
returned, as follows:

DEBUG Levels
************

**Level 0** 
  Errors only (DEBUG OFF, or DEBUG 0)
    
  In level 0, only msSetError() calls are logged to MS_ERORFILE. No msDebug() output at all. 
  This is the default and corresponds to the original behavior of MS_ERRORFILE in MapServer 4.x
    
**Level 1** 
  Errors and Notices (DEBUG ON, or DEBUG 1)
    
  Level 1 includes all output from Level 0 plus msDebug() warnings about common pitfalls, failed 
  assertions or non-fatal error situations (e.g. missing or invalid values for some parameters, 
  missing shapefiles in tileindex, timeout error from remote WMS/WFS servers, etc.)

**Level 2** 
  Map Tuning (DEBUG 2)
  
  Level 2 includes all output from Level 1 plus notices and timing information useful for tuning 
  mapfiles and applications.  *this is the recommended minimal debugging level*
  
**Level 3** 
  Verbose Debug (DEBUG 3)
  
  All of Level 2 plus some debug output useful in troubleshooting problems such as WMS connection 
  URLs being called, database connection calls, etc.

**Level 4** 
  Very Verbose Debug (DEBUG 4)
  
  Level 3 plus even more details...

**Level 5** 
  Very Very Verbose Debug (DEBUG 5)
  
  Level 4 plus any msDebug() output that might be more useful to developers than to users.


Mapfile Example
***************

The following example is the recommended method to set the *DEBUG* parameter:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"
     DEBUG 5
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END

The MS_DEBUGLEVEL Environment Variable
**************************************

Instead of setting the *DEBUG* Debug level in each of your mapfiles, you can also be set 
the level globally by using the *MS_DEBUGLEVEL* environment variable.

When set, this value is used as the default debug level value for all map and layer objects as they 
are loaded by the mapfile parser. This option also sets the debug level for any msDebug() call 
located outside of the context of a map or layer object, for instance for debug statements relating 
to initialization before a map is loaded. If a DEBUG value is also specified in the mapfile in 
some map or layer objects then the local value (in the mapfile) takes precedence over the 
value of the environment variable.

Apache users can set the environment variable in Apache's *httpd.conf* file, such as:

::

   SetEnv MS_DEBUGLEVEL 5

Windows users can alternatively set the environment variable through the Windows System 
Properties; but make sure to set a SYSTEM environment variable.

Step 3: Turn on CPL_DEBUG (optional)
------------------------------------

MapServer relies on the `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`__ library to access most data layers, so
you may wish to turn on GDAL debugging, to hopefully get more information on how GDAL is accessing 
your data file.  This could be very helpful for problems with accessing raster files and PostGIS 
tables.  You can trigger this GDAL output by setting the **CPL_DEBUG** variable in your mapfile, 
within the :ref:`MAP` object, such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "CPL_DEBUG" "ON"
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END
   
Step 4: Turn on PROJ_DEBUG (optional)
-------------------------------------

MapServer relies on the `PROJ.4 <http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/>`__ library to handle data projections, so
you may wish to turn on PROJ debugging, to hopefully get more information back from the PROJ library.  
You can trigger this PROJ output by setting the **PROJ_DEBUG** variable in your mapfile, 
within the :ref:`MAP` object, such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "PROJ_DEBUG" "ON"
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END

Step 5: Test your Mapfile
-------------------------

Once you have set the *MS_ERRORFILE* and *DEBUG* level in your mapfile, you should now test
your mapfile and read your generated log file.

Using shp2img
*************

The recommended way to test your mapfile is to use the MapServer commandline utility :ref:`shp2img`, 
to verify that your mapfile creates a valid map image. :ref:`shp2img` should be included in your MapServer 
installation  (`MS4W <http://www.maptools.org/ms4w>`__ users need to execute *setenv.bat* before 
using the utility).

You can set the *DEBUG* level by passing the :ref:`shp2img` following parameters to your commandline call:

.. NOTE::
   If you have already set *MS_ERRORFILE* in your mapfile, you must comment this out
   in order to use these :ref:`shp2img` options
   
.. NOTE::
   When using :ref:`shp2img` to debug, your layer's STATUS should be set to ON or DEFAULT.  If the 
   layer's STATUS is set to OFF, you must additionally pass the layer name to :ref:`shp2img` by using the 
   "``-l layername``" syntax
   
-all_debug
^^^^^^^^^^

Use this setting to set the debug level for the MAP object and all layers. *this is the recommended switch
to use*

::
  
  shp2img -m spain.map -o test.png -all_debug 5
  
    msLoadMap(): 0.002s
    msDrawMap(): Layer 0 (spain provinces), 0.012s

-map_debug
^^^^^^^^^^

Use this setting to set the debug level for the MAP object only.

::

  shp2img -m spain.map -o test.png -map_debug 5
  
    msDrawMap(): Layer 0 (spain provinces), 0.012s
    msDrawRasterLayerLow(orthophoto): entering.
    msDrawMap(): Layer 1 (orthophoto), 0.144s
    msDrawMap(): Layer 2 (urban areas), 0.004s

    msSaveImage() total time: 0.039s
    msFreeMap(): freeing map at 0205C1A8.

-layer_debug
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use this setting to set the debug level for one layer object only.

::
 
  shp2img -m spain.map -o test.png -layer_debug orthophoto 5
  
    msDrawRasterLayerLow(orthophoto): entering.
    msDrawGDAL(): src=0,0,3540,2430, dst=188,48,1,1
    source raster PL (-793.394,-1712.627) for dst PL (188,48).
    msDrawGDAL(): red,green,blue,alpha bands = 1,2,3,0
    msDrawMap(): Layer 1 (orthophoto), 0.151s
    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 02F23390.
    
Set CPL_DEBUG
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the commandline execute the following:

::

  set CPL_DEBUG=ON

  shp2img -m spain.map -o test.png -layer_debug orthophoto 5
  
    msDrawRasterLayerLow(orthophoto): entering.
    GDAL: GDALOpen(D:\ms4w\apps\spain\map/.\../data/ov172068_200904_c100u50x75c24n.jpg, this=0
    4059840) succeeds as JPEG.
    msDrawGDAL(): src=0,0,3540,2430, dst=188,48,1,1
    source raster PL (-793.394,-1712.627) for dst PL (188,48).
    msDrawGDAL(): red,green,blue,alpha bands = 1,2,3,0
    GDAL: GDALDefaultOverviews::OverviewScan()
    msDrawMap(): Layer 1 (orthophoto), 0.155s
    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 03113390.
    GDAL: GDALDeregister_GTiff() called.

Reading Errors Returned by shp2img
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is a problem with your mapfile, :ref:`shp2img` should output the line number in your 
mapfile that is causing the trouble.  The following tells us that there is a problem on line 85
of my mapfile:

::

  getSymbol(): Symbol definition error. Parsing error near (truetype2):(line 85)
  
If you are using mapfile :ref:`INCLUDEs <include>`, it may be tricky to track down this line number,
but most of the time the line number is useful.

Using mapserv CGI
*****************

Another handy way to test your mapfile is to call the mapserv CGI executable at the 
:ref:`commandline <mapserv>`, such as the following:

::

  mapserv -nh "QUERY_STRING=map=/ms4w/apps/spain/map/spain.map&mode=map"

ON_MISSING_DATA
***************

If you are using tile indexes to access your data, you should also be aware of the
configuration settings added in MapServer 5.4 that allow you to tell MapServer how to 
handle missing data in tile indexes.  Please see the *CONFIG* parameter's *ON_MISSING_DATA* setting
in the :ref:`map` object for more information.

.. HINT::
   You can check the attributes in the tileindex by executing "*ogrinfo -al*" on your data file

Step 6: Check your Web Server Logs
----------------------------------

Once you have verified that there are no problems with you mapfile, next you should check your Web
server log files, for any related information that may help you narrow down your problem.

Apache
******

Unix users will usually find Apache's *error_log* file in a path similar to:

::

  /var/log/apache2/
  
Windows users will usually find Apache's log files in a path similar to:

::

  C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\logs
  
MapServer for Windows (`MS4W <http://www.maptools.org/ms4w>`__) users will find Apache's log files at:

::

  \ms4w\Apache\logs
  
Microsoft IIS
************* 

IIS log files can be located by:

1. Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools
2. Open the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
3. Find your Web site under the tree on the left.
4. Right-click on it and choose Properties.
5. On the Web site tab, you will see an option near the bottom that says "Active Log Format." Click on the 
   Properties button.
   
    .. image:: ../images/iis-debug.png 

6. At the bottom of the General Properties tab, you will see a box that contains the log file directory 
   and the log file name. The full log path is comprised of the log file directory plus the first part 
   of the log file name, for example:
   ::
   
     C:\WINDOWS\system32\LogFiles\W3SVC1\ex100507.log
     
You may also want to check the Windows Event Viewer logs, which is located at:

1. Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools
2. Computer Management
3. Event Viewer

.. WARNING::
   As mentioned previously, in IIS the MapServer *stderr* debug output is returned to 
   the client instead of routed to the Web Server logs, so be sure to log the output
   to a file, using:
   
   ::
   
     CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"

CGI Error - The specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set of HTTP headers
****************************************************************************************************

This error is often caused by missing DLL files.  You should try to execute "*mapserv -v* at the 
commandline, to make sure that MapServer loads properly.


Step 7: Verify your Application Settings
----------------------------------------

If you have verified that MapServer creates a valid map image through :ref:`shp2img`, you've checked
your MapServer log files, and there are no problems noted in your Web server logs, then you should 
focus your attention on possible application configuration problems.  "Application" here means how 
you are displaying your map images on the Web page, such as with `OpenLayers <http://www.openlayers.org>`__.

PHP MapScript
*************

If you are using PHP MapScript in your application, here are some important notes for debugging:

1. Make sure your *php.ini* file is configured to show all errors, by setting:

   ::
   
     display_errors = On


2. To enable debugging in PHP MapScript, if you are using MapServer 5.6.0 or more
   recent, make sure to define *ZEND_DEBUG* in the PHP source.
   
   If you are using MapServer < 5.6.0, then:

   - open the file */mapscript/php3/php_mapscript.c*

   - change the following:

     ::
     
       #define ZEND_DEBUG 0

       to

       #define ZEND_DEBUG 1

Debugging MapServer using Compiler Debugging Tools
==================================================

Running MapServer in GDB (Linux/Unix)
-------------------------------------

.. sectionauthor:: Frank Warmerdam

Building with Symbolic Debug Info
*********************************

It is not strictly necessary to build MapServer with debugging enabled
in order to use `GDB <http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/>`__ on linux, but it does 
ensure that more meaningful information is reported within GDB.  To enable full 
symbolic information use the *--enable-debug* configure switch.  Note that use of 
this switch disables optimization and so it should not normally be used for production
builds where performance is important.

::

  ./configure --enable-debug <other switches>
  make clean
  make

Running in the Debugger
***********************

To run either mapserv or shp2img, give the name of the executable as an
argument to the "gdb" command.  If it is not in the path, you will need
to provide the full path to the executable.

::

  gdb shp2img
  GNU gdb (GDB) 7.0-ubuntu

  For bug reporting instructions, please see:
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/>...
  Reading symbols from /wrk/home/warmerda/mapserver/shp2img...done.
  (gdb)

Once you are at the "(gdb)" prompt you can use the run command with the
arguments you would normally have passed to the mapserv or shp2img
executable.

::

  (gdb) run -m test.map -o out.png
  Starting program: /wrk/home/warmerda/mapserver/shp2img -m test.map -o out.png
  [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]

  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  0x00007ffff67594a2 in JP2KAKDataset::Identify (poOpenInfo=0x0)
    at jp2kakdataset.cpp:962
  962         if( poOpenInfo->nHeaderBytes < (int) sizeof(jp2_header) )
  Current language:  auto
  The current source language is "auto; currently c++".
  (gdb)

If the program is crashing, you will generally get a report like the above
indicating the function the crash occurred in, and some minimal
information on why.  It is often useful to request a traceback to see
what functions led to the function that crashed.  For this use the "where"
command.

::

  (gdb) where
  #0  0x00007ffff67594a2 in JP2KAKDataset::Identify (poOpenInfo=0x0)
      at jp2kakdataset.cpp:962

  #6  0x0000000000486a48 in msDrawLayer (map=0x81e450, layer=0x839140,

  #8  0x0000000000446410 in main (argc=5, argv=0x7fffffffd918) at shp2img.c:300
  (gdb)

It may also be helpful to examine variables used in the line where the
crash occured.   Use the print command for this.

::

  (gdb) print poOpenInfo
  $1 = (GDALOpenInfo *) 0x0

In this case we see that the program crashed because poOpenInfo was NULL (zero).
Including a traceback like the above in bug report can help the developers
narrow down a problem more quickly, especially if it is one that is difficult
for the developers to reproduce themselves.

Debugging Older Versions of MapServer (before 5.0)
==================================================

1. Make sure that MapServer is compiled in debug mode (on unix this is
   enabled through *./configure --enable-debug*).
   
   You can verify that your build was compiled in debug mode, by executing
   the following at the commandline (look for "DEBUG=MSDEBUG"):
   
   ::
   
     ./mapserv -v
     
       MapServer version 4.10.2 OUTPUT=GIF OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=WBMP
       OUTPUT=SVG SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER
       SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WCS_SERVER SUPPORTS=THREADS SUPPORTS=GEOS
       INPUT=EPPL7 INPUT=POSTGIS INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE
       DEBUG=MSDEBUG 

2. Set the *MS_ERRORFILE* variable is in your mapfile, within the :ref:`MAP` object, 
   such as:

   .. code-block:: mapfile

     MAP
       ...
       CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"
       ...
       LAYER
         ...
       END
     END
     
3. If you don't use the *MS_ERRORFILE* variable, you can use the LOG parameter in
   your :ref:`WEB` object of the mapfile, such as:
   
   .. code-block:: mapfile

      MAP
       ...
       WEB
         LOG "mapserver.log"
       END
       ...
       LAYER
         ...
       END
     END   

4. Specify *DEBUG ON* in your MAP object, or in your LAYER objects, such as:

   .. code-block:: mapfile

      MAP
       ...
       WEB
         LOG "mapserver.log"
       END       
       DEBUG ON
       ...
       LAYER
         ...
       END
     END

5. Note that only errors will be written to the log file; all DEBUG output 
   goes to stderr, in the case of Apache that is Apache's *error_log* file. If you are 
   using Microsoft IIS, debug output is routed to *stdout* (i.e. the browser), so be sure 
   to remove *DEBUG ON* statements if using IIS on a production server.
