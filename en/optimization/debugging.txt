Introduction
============

When developing an application for the Internet, you will inevitably
across problems many problems in your environment.  The goal of this
guide is to assist you with locating the problem with your MapServer
application.

- :ref:`RFC 28: Redesign of LOG/DEBUG output mechanisms <rfc28>`
- :ref:`MapServer Errors <errors>`

Steps to Enable MapServer Debugging
===================================

Starting with MapServer 5.0, you are able to control the levels of
debugging/logging information returned to you by MapServer, and also
control the location of the output log file.

In technical terms, there are msDebug() calls in various areas of the
MapServer code that generate information that may be useful in tuning
and troubleshooting applications.

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; MS_ERRORFILE

Step 1: Set the MS_ERRORFILE Variable
-------------------------------------

The **MS_ERRORFILE** variable is used to specify the output of debug
messages from MapServer.  You can pass the following values to
**MS_ERRORFILE**:

**[filename]**
  Full path and filename of a log file, to contain MapServer's debug
  messages.  Any file extension can be used, but *.log* or *.txt* is
  recommended.  The file will be created, if it does not already
  exist.

  Starting with MapServer 6.0, a filename with relative path can be passed
  via the CONFIG MS_ERRORFILE directive, in which case the filename is
  relative to the mapfile location. Note that setting MS_ERRORFILE via an
  environment variable always requires an absolute path since there would
  be no mapfile to make the path relative to.

**stderr**
  Use this to send MapServer's debug messages to the Web server's log
  file (i.e. "standard error").  If you are using Apache, your debug
  messages will be placed in the Apache *error_log* file.  If you are
  using Microsoft IIS, your debug messages will be sent to *stdout*
  (i.e. the browser), so its use is discouraged. With IIS it is
  recommended to direct output to a file instead.

**stdout**
  Use this to send MapServer's debug messages to the standard output
  (i.e. the browser), combined with the rest of MapServer's output.

**windowsdebug**
  Use this to send MapServer's debug messages to the Windows
  OutputDebugString API, allowing the use of external programs like
  SysInternals debugview to display the debug output.


Through the Mapfile
*******************

The recommended way to set the **MS_ERRORFILE** variable is in your
mapfile, within the :ref:`MAP` object, such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END

Through an Environment Variable
*******************************

You can also set the **MS_ERRORFILE** variable as an environment
variable on your system.  Apache users can set the environment
variable in Apache's *httpd.conf* file, such as:

::

   SetEnv MS_ERRORFILE "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"

Windows users can alternatively set the environment variable through
the Windows System Properties; but make sure to set a SYSTEM
environment variable.

.. NOTE::
   If both the *MS_ERRORFILE* environment variable is set and a
   *CONFIG MS_ERRORFILE* is also set, then the CONFIG directive takes
   precedence.

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; Debug levels

Step 2: Set the DEBUG Level
---------------------------

You can retrieve varying types of debug messages by setting the
*DEBUG* parameter in the :ref:`mapfile`.  You can place the *DEBUG*
parameter in any LAYER in the mapfile for layer-specific debug information,
or instead, set it once in the MAP object to get general debug information.  
Use the value of the *DEBUG* parameter to set the type of information 
returned, as follows:

DEBUG Levels
************

**Level 0**
  Errors only (DEBUG OFF, or DEBUG 0)

  In level 0, only msSetError() calls are logged to MS_ERORFILE. No
  msDebug() output at all.  This is the default and corresponds to the
  original behavior of MS_ERRORFILE in MapServer 4.x

**Level 1**
  Errors and Notices (DEBUG ON, or DEBUG 1)

  Level 1 includes all output from Level 0 plus msDebug() warnings
  about common pitfalls, failed assertions or non-fatal error
  situations (e.g. missing or invalid values for some parameters,
  missing shapefiles in tileindex, timeout error from remote WMS/WFS
  servers, etc.)

**Level 2**
  Map Tuning (DEBUG 2)

  Level 2 includes all output from Level 1 plus notices and timing
  information useful for tuning mapfiles and applications.  *this is
  the recommended minimal debugging level*

**Level 3**
  Verbose Debug (DEBUG 3)

  All of Level 2 plus some debug output useful in troubleshooting
  problems such as WMS connection URLs being called, database
  connection calls, etc.

**Level 4**
  Very Verbose Debug (DEBUG 4)

  Level 3 plus even more details...

**Level 5**
  Very Very Verbose Debug (DEBUG 5)

  Level 4 plus any msDebug() output that might be more useful to
  developers than to users.


Mapfile Example: Map-Level Debug
********************************

The following example is the recommended method to set the *DEBUG* parameter
for the map-level:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"
     DEBUG 5
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; MS_DEBUGLEVEL
   
Mapfile Example: Layer-Level Debug
**********************************

The following example is the recommended method to set the *DEBUG* parameter
for a layer:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"
     ...
     LAYER
       DEBUG 5
       ...
     END
   END

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; MS_DEBUGLEVEL   

The MS_DEBUGLEVEL Environment Variable
**************************************

Instead of setting the *DEBUG* Debug level in each of your mapfiles,
you can also be set the level globally by using the *MS_DEBUGLEVEL*
environment variable.

.. TIP::
   Although setting the MS_DEBUGLEVEL environment variable is possible,
   it is strongly encouraged to set DEBUG inside your mapfile for the map, 
   layer, or class objects instead.

When set, this value is used as the default debug level value for all
map and layer objects as they are loaded by the mapfile parser. This
option also sets the debug level for any msDebug() call located
outside of the context of a map or layer object, for instance for
debug statements relating to initialization before a map is loaded. If
a DEBUG value is also specified in the mapfile in some map or layer
objects then the local value (in the mapfile) takes precedence over
the value of the environment variable; debug info coming from outside 
of the context of a map or layer object cannot be turned off by 
having DEBUG OFF in the mapfile.

Setting this option (*MS_DEBUGLEVEL*) is mostly useful when tuning 
applications by enabling timing/debug output before the map is loaded, 
to capture the full process initialization and map loading time, 
for instance.

Apache users can set the environment variable in Apache's *httpd.conf*
file, such as:

::

   SetEnv MS_DEBUGLEVEL 5

Windows users can alternatively set the environment variable through
the Windows System Properties; but make sure to set a SYSTEM
environment variable.

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; CPL_DEBUG

Step 3: Turn on CPL_DEBUG (optional)
------------------------------------

MapServer relies on the `GDAL <https://gdal.org/>`__ library to
access most data layers, so you may wish to turn on GDAL debugging, to
hopefully get more information on how GDAL is accessing your data
file.  This could be very helpful for problems with accessing raster
files and PostGIS tables.  You can trigger this GDAL output by setting
the **CPL_DEBUG** variable in your mapfile, within the :ref:`MAP`
object, such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "CPL_DEBUG" "ON"
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END
   
You can also add a timestamp (a date/time on each line) to that report 
with the **CPL_TIMESTAMP** variable, such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "CPL_DEBUG" "ON"
     CONFIG "CPL_TIMESTAMP" "ON"
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END

.. NOTE::
   For a good list of GDAL's possible variables to use, see the 
   `GDAL wiki <https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/ConfigOptions>`__.
   The main GDAL site also has a `list <https://gdal.org/user/configoptions.html#list-of-configuration-options-and-where-they-apply>`__.
   
.. seealso::
    :ref:`Additional PostGIS debugging for MapServer <debugging_postgis>`  

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; PROJ_DEBUG

Step 4: Turn on PROJ_DEBUG (optional)
-------------------------------------

MapServer relies on the `PROJ <https://proj.org/>`__
library to handle data projections, so you may wish to turn on PROJ
debugging, to hopefully get more information back from the PROJ
library.  You can trigger this PROJ output by setting the
**PROJ_DEBUG** variable in your mapfile, within the :ref:`MAP` object,
such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "CPL_DEBUG" "ON"
     CONFIG "PROJ_DEBUG" "ON"
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END
   
.. NOTE::
   You can set *"CPL_DEBUG" "PROJ"* to restrict the information returned to PROJ
   (and not GDAL in general)
   
.. NOTE::
   For the full list of possible PROJ variables to use see the  
   `official list <https://proj.org/usage/environmentvars.html>`__.   

Step 5: Test your Mapfile
-------------------------

Once you have set the *MS_ERRORFILE* and *DEBUG* level in your
mapfile, you should now test your mapfile and read your generated log
file.

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; shp2img

Using shp2img
*************

The recommended way to test your mapfile is to use the MapServer
commandline utility :ref:`shp2img`, to verify that your mapfile
creates a valid map image. :ref:`shp2img` should be included in your
MapServer installation (`MS4W <http://www.ms4w.com>`__ users
need to execute *setenv.bat* before using the utility).

You can set the *DEBUG* level by passing the :ref:`shp2img` following
parameters to your commandline call:

.. NOTE::
   If you have already set *MS_ERRORFILE* in your mapfile, you must
   comment this out in order to use these :ref:`shp2img` options

.. NOTE::
   When using :ref:`shp2img` to debug, your layer's STATUS should be
   set to ON or DEFAULT.  If the layer's STATUS is set to OFF, you
   must additionally pass the layer name to :ref:`shp2img` by using
   the "`-l layername`" syntax

-all_debug
^^^^^^^^^^

Use this setting to set the debug level for the MAP object and all
layers. *this is the recommended switch to use*

::

  shp2img -m spain.map -o test.png -all_debug 5

    msLoadMap(): 0.002s
    msDrawMap(): Layer 0 (spain provinces), 0.012s
    msDrawRasterLayerLow(orthophoto): entering.
    msDrawGDAL(): src=0,0,3540,2430, dst=188,48,1,1

    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 0218F5E0.
    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 030C33A0.
    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 030C3BC8.
    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 030C4948.
    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 030C7678.
    shp2img total time: 1.567s

-map_debug
^^^^^^^^^^

Use this setting to set the debug level for the MAP object only.

::

  shp2img -m spain.map -o test.png -map_debug 5

    msDrawMap(): Layer 0 (spain provinces), 0.012s
    msDrawRasterLayerLow(orthophoto): entering.
    msDrawMap(): Layer 1 (orthophoto), 0.144s
    msDrawMap(): Layer 2 (urban areas), 0.004s
    msDrawMap(): Layer 3 (species at risk), 0.008s
    msDrawMap(): Layer 4 (populated places), 1.323s
    msDrawMap(): Drawing Label Cache, 0.013s
    msDrawMap() total time: 1.511s
    msSaveImage() total time: 0.039s
    msFreeMap(): freeing map at 0205C1A8.

-layer_debug
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use this setting to set the debug level for one layer object only.

::

  shp2img -m spain.map -o test.png -layer_debug orthophoto 5

    msDrawRasterLayerLow(orthophoto): entering.
    msDrawGDAL(): src=0,0,3540,2430, dst=188,48,1,1
    source raster PL (-793.394,-1712.627) for dst PL (188,48).
    msDrawGDAL(): red,green,blue,alpha bands = 1,2,3,0
    msDrawMap(): Layer 1 (orthophoto), 0.151s
    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 02F23390.

Set CPL_DEBUG
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the commandline execute the following:

::

  set CPL_DEBUG=ON

  shp2img -m spain.map -o test.png -layer_debug orthophoto 5

    msDrawRasterLayerLow(orthophoto): entering.
    GDAL: GDALOpen(D:\ms4w\apps\spain\map/.\../data/ov172068_200904_c100u50x75c24n.jpg, this=0
    4059840) succeeds as JPEG.
    msDrawGDAL(): src=0,0,3540,2430, dst=188,48,1,1
    source raster PL (-793.394,-1712.627) for dst PL (188,48).
    msDrawGDAL(): red,green,blue,alpha bands = 1,2,3,0
    GDAL: GDALDefaultOverviews::OverviewScan()
    msDrawMap(): Layer 1 (orthophoto), 0.155s
    freeLayer(): freeing layer at 03113390.
    GDAL: GDALDeregister_GTiff() called.

Reading Errors Returned by shp2img
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is a problem with your mapfile, :ref:`shp2img` should output
the line number in your mapfile that is causing the trouble.  The
following tells us that there is a problem on line 85 of my mapfile:

::

  getSymbol(): Symbol definition error. Parsing error near (truetype2):(line 85)

If you are using mapfile :ref:`INCLUDEs <include>`, it may be tricky
to track down this line number, but most of the time the line number
is useful.

Using mapserv CGI
*****************

Another handy way to test your mapfile is to call the mapserv CGI
executable at the :ref:`commandline <mapserv>`, such as the following:

::

  mapserv -nh "QUERY_STRING=map=/ms4w/apps/spain/map/spain.map&mode=map"

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; ON_MISSING_DATA

ON_MISSING_DATA
***************

If you are using tile indexes to access your data, you should also be
aware of the configuration settings added in MapServer 5.4 that allow
you to tell MapServer how to handle missing data in tile indexes.
Please see the *CONFIG* parameter's *ON_MISSING_DATA* setting in the
:ref:`map` object for more information.

.. HINT::
   You can check the attributes in the tileindex by executing
   "*ogrinfo -al*" on your data file

Step 6: Check your Web Server Logs
----------------------------------

Once you have verified that there are no problems with you mapfile,
next you should check your Web server log files, for any related
information that may help you narrow down your problem.

Apache
******

Unix users will usually find Apache's *error_log* file in a path
similar to:

::

  /var/log/apache2/

Windows users will usually find Apache's log files in a path similar to:

::

  C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\logs

MapServer for Windows (`MS4W <http://www.ms4w.com>`__) users
will find Apache's log files at:

::

  \ms4w\Apache\logs

Microsoft IIS
*************

IIS log files can be located by:

1. Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools
2. Open the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
3. Find your Web site under the tree on the left.
4. Right-click on it and choose Properties.
5. On the Web site tab, you will see an option near the bottom that
   says "Active Log Format." Click on the Properties button.

    .. image:: ../images/iis-debug.png

6. At the bottom of the General Properties tab, you will see a box
   that contains the log file directory and the log file name. The
   full log path is comprised of the log file directory plus the first
   part of the log file name, for example::

     C:\WINDOWS\system32\LogFiles\W3SVC1\ex100507.log

You may also want to check the Windows Event Viewer logs, which is located at:

1. Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools
2. Computer Management
3. Event Viewer

.. WARNING::
   As mentioned previously, in IIS the MapServer *stderr* debug output
   is returned to the client instead of routed to the Web Server logs,
   so be sure to log the output to a file, by setting the following in
   your mapfile:

::

  CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"

CGI Error - The specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set of HTTP headers
****************************************************************************************************

This error is often caused by missing DLL files.  You should try to
execute "*mapserv -v* at the commandline, to make sure that MapServer
loads properly.

Step 7: Verify your Application Settings
----------------------------------------

If you have verified that MapServer creates a valid map image through
:ref:`shp2img`, you've checked your MapServer log files, and there are
no problems noted in your Web server logs, then you should focus your
attention on possible application configuration problems.
"Application" here means how you are displaying your map images on the
Web page, such as with `OpenLayers <http://www.openlayers.org>`__.

Step 8: Use QGIS to test your OGC services
------------------------------------------

When configuring MapServer for OGC services (WMS, WFS, etc.) it sometimes
happens that users of your services report map issues in a desktop GIS or 
online application, even though no errors, logs, or local shp2img tests 
give any hints; this is where the `QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ 
*Network Logger* can really help to get the exact problem request.  For 
steps on how to implement the network logger see 
`here <https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/wiki/Get-the-Raw-WMS-Request-Generated-by-QGIS>`__.

.. TIP::
   To get the exact problem request, add your MapServer service as a QGIS layer, 
   then right-click on the request in the Network Logger and select 
   "Open URL" to see the full request and resulting map image in your browser.

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; PHP Mapscript

PHP MapScript
*************

If you are using PHP MapScript in your application, here are some
important notes for debugging:

1. Make sure your *php.ini* file is configured to show all errors, by
setting:

   ::

     display_errors = On


2. To enable debugging in PHP MapScript, if you are using MapServer
   5.6.0 or more recent, make sure to define *ZEND_DEBUG* in the PHP
   source.

   If you are using MapServer < 5.6.0, then:

   - open the file */mapscript/php3/php_mapscript.c*

   - change the following:

     ::

       #define ZEND_DEBUG 0

       to

       #define ZEND_DEBUG 1

Debugging MapServer using Compiler Debugging Tools
==================================================

.. index::
   pair: Debugging; GDB

Running MapServer in GDB (Linux/Unix)
-------------------------------------

.. sectionauthor:: Frank Warmerdam

Building with Symbolic Debug Info
*********************************

It is not strictly necessary to build MapServer with debugging enabled
in order to use `GDB <http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/>`__ on linux,
but it does ensure that more meaningful information is reported within
GDB.  To enable full symbolic information use the *--enable-debug*
configure switch.  Note that use of this switch disables optimization
and so it should not normally be used for production builds where
performance is important.

::

  ./configure --enable-debug <other switches>
  make clean
  make

Running in the Debugger
***********************

To run either mapserv or shp2img, give the name of the executable as an
argument to the "gdb" command.  If it is not in the path, you will need
to provide the full path to the executable.

::

  gdb shp2img

  For bug reporting instructions, please see:

  Reading symbols from /wrk/home/warmerda/mapserver/shp2img...done.
  (gdb)

Once you are at the "(gdb)" prompt you can use the run command with the
arguments you would normally have passed to the mapserv or shp2img
executable.

::

  (gdb) run -m test.map -o out.png
  Starting program: /wrk/home/warmerda/mapserver/shp2img -m test.map -o out.png
  [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]

  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  0x00007ffff67594a2 in JP2KAKDataset::Identify (poOpenInfo=0x0)
    at jp2kakdataset.cpp:962
  962         if( poOpenInfo->nHeaderBytes < (int) sizeof(jp2_header) )
  Current language:  auto
  The current source language is "auto; currently c++".
  (gdb)

If the program is crashing, you will generally get a report like the above
indicating the function the crash occurred in, and some minimal
information on why.  It is often useful to request a traceback to see
what functions led to the function that crashed.  For this use the "where"
command.

::

  (gdb) where

  #8  0x0000000000446410 in main (argc=5, argv=0x7fffffffd918) at shp2img.c:300
  (gdb)

It may also be helpful to examine variables used in the line where the
crash occurred.  Use the print command for this.

::

  (gdb) print poOpenInfo
  $1 = (GDALOpenInfo *) 0x0

In this case we see that the program crashed because poOpenInfo was
NULL (zero).  Including a traceback like the above in bug report can
help the developers narrow down a problem more quickly, especially if
it is one that is difficult for the developers to reproduce
themselves.

Debugging Older Versions of MapServer (before 5.0)
==================================================

1. Make sure that MapServer is compiled in debug mode (on unix this is
   enabled through *./configure --enable-debug*).

   You can verify that your build was compiled in debug mode, by
   executing the following at the commandline (look for
   "DEBUG=MSDEBUG"):

   ::

     ./mapserv -v

       MapServer version 4.10.2 OUTPUT=GIF OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=WBMP
       OUTPUT=SVG SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER
       SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WCS_SERVER SUPPORTS=THREADS SUPPORTS=GEOS
       INPUT=EPPL7 INPUT=POSTGIS INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE
       DEBUG=MSDEBUG

2. Set the *MS_ERRORFILE* variable is in your mapfile, within the
   :ref:`MAP` object, such as:

   .. code-block:: mapfile

     MAP
       ...
       CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"
       ...
       LAYER
         ...
       END
     END

3. If you don't use the *MS_ERRORFILE* variable, you can use the LOG
   parameter in your :ref:`WEB` object of the mapfile, such as:

   .. code-block:: mapfile

      MAP
       ...
       WEB
         LOG "mapserver.log"
       END
       ...
       LAYER
         ...
       END
     END

4. Specify *DEBUG ON* in your MAP object, or in your LAYER objects,
   such as:

   .. code-block:: mapfile

      MAP
       ...
       WEB
         LOG "mapserver.log"
       END
       DEBUG ON
       ...
       LAYER
         ...
       END
     END

5. Note that only errors will be written to the log file; all DEBUG
   output goes to stderr, in the case of Apache that is Apache's
   *error_log* file. If you are using Microsoft IIS, debug output is
   routed to *stdout* (i.e. the browser), so be sure to remove *DEBUG
   ON* statements if using IIS on a production server.
