Introduction
============

The contents of a .map file ('mapfile') are used by MapServer for configuration, data
access, projection, and more. Because the mapfile is parsed every time a map
image is requested, it is important to think about what you include in the
file in order to optimize performance. The optimal mapfile is one that
doesn't include or reference anything that isn't needed.  The following steps will
help you both manage and optimize your mapfiles.

.. index::
   pair: Optimization; Projections
   
.. NOTE::
   As you optimize your setup, it is strongly recommended to review the security steps 
   for the *MAP=* call to the MapServer executable, by setting *MS_MAP_PATTERN* or 
   *MS_MAP_NO_PATH* or hiding the *MAP=* parameter on public servers, 
   as recommended in the document :ref:`limit_mapfile_access`.  All possible
   environment variables to secure your server are listed in :ref:`environment_variables`.

Steps to Possibly Review
========================  

1. Use a MapServer Syntax file for your Favorite Text Editor
------------------------------------------------------------

Although it's maybe not be classed as an 'optimization', using a syntax 
file to add color-coding to MapServer mapfile parameters in your text editor,
can help save you time and make your MapServer-mapfile-management-life
much easier.  You can find a helpful list of these syntax color-coding tools for
MapServer listed on the page at :ref:`editing`.

2. Testing your Mapfile for Speed
---------------------------------

If optimization and performance are important to you, then get to know and love
the MapServer commandline utility :ref:`shp2img`. *shp2img* will verify that your 
mapfile creates a valid map image, but it can also display draw times (length of 
time it takes MapServer to process each layer and the final map image) with the
*-map_debug 3* setting:

::

  shp2img -m osm.map -o ttt.png -map_debug 3
  
  msDrawMap(): rendering using outputformat named png (AGG/PNG).
  msDrawMap(): WMS/WFS set-up and query, 0.000s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 95 (land13), 0.001s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 96 (landuse13), 0.051s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 97 (transport_areas13), 0.002s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 98 (waterarea13), 0.003s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 99 (waterways13), 0.002s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 100 (railways13), 0.003s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 101 (roads13), 0.024s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 102 (aeroways13), 0.002s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 103 (buildings13), 0.245s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 104 (borders13), 0.197s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 105 (places13), 0.078s
  msDrawLabelCache(): labelcache_map_edge_buffer = 10
  msDrawMap(): Drawing Label Cache, 0.020s
  msDrawMap() total time: 0.772s
  msSaveImage(ttt.png) total time: 0.056s  

The above example generates a map image in *0.772 seconds*.

Hint: If you want maximum (verbose) messages, try the *-all_debug 5* setting
instead.

You can also just get draw times for a single layer with the *-l layername* switch,
such as:

::

  shp2img -m osm.map -o ttt.png -map_debug 3 -l buildings13
  
  msDrawMap(): rendering using outputformat named png (AGG/PNG).
  msDrawMap(): WMS/WFS set-up and query, 0.000s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 103 (buildings13), 0.119s
  msDrawLabelCache(): labelcache_map_edge_buffer = 10
  msDrawMap(): Drawing Label Cache, 0.001s
  msDrawMap() total time: 0.120s
  msSaveImage(ttt.png) total time: 0.016s
  

.. NOTE::
    :ref:`shp2img` should be included in your
    MapServer installation (`MS4W <https://ms4w.com>`__ users
    need to execute *setenv.bat* before using the utility).
    
3. Use the various CONFIG settings for debugging
------------------------------------------------

Review the :ref:`debugging` document and try setting the CONFIG parameter
at the MAP-level in your mapfile, to hopefully get more information 
from various sources such as from the PROJ library, GDAL library, etc.

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     CONFIG "CPL_DEBUG" "ON"
     CONFIG "PROJ_DEBUG" "ON"
     ...
     LAYER
       ...
     END
   END
   
.. NOTE::
   You can set *"CPL_DEBUG" "PROJ"* to restrict the information returned to PROJ
   (and not GDAL in general)

4. Test the full Map Request through the mapserv Executable
-----------------------------------------------------------

There are times when your mapfile generates a valid map image with a local
shp2img command, but then the same mapfile will cause an error in a map
request through the web server, such as Apache.  It is these times when
you should try the same request, that was sent through your web server, at 
the commandline with the actual *mapserv* (or on Windows, the *mapserv.exe*) 
utility.

The following request will take a full *MAP=...&MODE=map* request, and try to save
the request to an image, or report an error:

::

  mapserv -nh "QUERY_STRING=MAP=/ms4w/apps/local-demo/local.map&MODE=map" > test.png
  
You can use this to also test problematic WMS GetMap requests as well:

::

  mapserv -nh "QUERY_STRING=SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=41.42710000000000292,-173.4329999999999927,83.74660000000000082,-13.04809999999999981&CRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=369&HEIGHT=98&LAYERS=park&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png&DPI=96&MAP_RESOLUTION=96&FORMAT_OPTIONS=dpi:96&TRANSPARENT=TRUE" > test.png
  
**Note:** Besides checking your web server logs, you can also use QGIS to get the exact 
request to your OWS (WMS/WFS etc.) service: see https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/wiki/Get-the-Raw-WMS-Request-Generated-by-QGIS

5. Projections
--------------

There are two ways to define projections in a mapfile. You can either use
inline projection parameters or specify an EPSG code for that projection. If
you use the :term:`EPSG` code method, :term:`PROJ` looks up the projection
parameters in the PROJ database using the EPSG code as an ID. This database
lookup takes significantly more resources than when the projection parameters
are defined inline. This lookup takes place for each projection definition
using EPSG codes in a mapfile.

.. seealso:: :ref:`projection`  

**Projection defined using inline projection parameters**

.. code-block:: mapfile

    PROJECTION
      "proj=utm"
      "ellps=GRS80"
      "datum=NAD83"
      "zone=15"
      "units=m"
      "north"
      "no_defs"
    END
    
**Projection defined using EPSG Code**

.. code-block:: mapfile

    PROJECTION
       "init=epsg:26915"
    END

**Optimization Suggestions**

- Use inline projection parameter definitions in place of EPSG codes.

- It should be stated that for optimal performance you could have MapServer
  not do any projections on-demand (in other words, have all of your source
  data in the same projection, and have MapServer output requests in that 
  same projection) but obviously this is not always possible for all scenarios.

- If you want to use EPSG codes, remove all unneeded projection definition
  records from the PROJ :term:`EPSG` database.
  
  .. NOTE::
       This was a common trick for PROJ versions <6 (and its *epsg* file), 
       but for PROJ >= 6 a *proj.db* SQLite database is used to store
       these EPSG lookup codes, and optimizations for that will take some 
       time to be developed and shared).
  
.. index::
   pair: Optimization; Layers

6. Use INCLUDEs
---------------

Implemented back in MapServer 4.10, the mapfile :ref:`include` parameter is 
possibly one of the best ways to help manage your large mapfiles (you might 
argue that this is not 'optimization' for speed again, but for it is very 
important for managing large mapfiles with many layers).

Any part of the mapfile can be referenced through an INCLUDE, besides the 
obvious layers.  

.. NOTE::
     Common file extensions for includes are: *.lyr*, *.include*, or even *.map* 
     . You can name them any file extension that you wish.
     
You could have something like:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   MAP
     ...
     WEB
       INCLUDE "metadata.include"
     END
     ...
     INCLUDE "elevation.lyr"
     INCLUDE "country.lyr"
     INCLUDE "city.lyr"
     ...
   END
   
Where *metadata.include* could contain:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_title"          "WMS Demo Server"  ##required
      "wms_onlineresource" "http://yourpath/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?"   ##required
      "wms_srs"            "EPSG:3857 EPSG:4326 EPSG:4269 EPSG:3978"  ##recommended
      "wms_enable_request" "*"   ##necessary
    END

7. Layers
---------

For every layer in a mapfile that has a status of ON or DEFAULT, MapServer
will load that layer and prepare it for display, even if that layer never gets
displayed.

**Optimization Suggestions**

- Build lean mapfiles, only include layers that you plan to use.  

- Turn off unnecessary layers; the more layers MapServer is displaying, the
  more time it takes. Have your opening map view show only the minimum
  necessary to orient the user, and allow them to turn on additional layers as
  needed. This is particularly true of remote WMS or very large rasters.

- Related to turning off layers, is turning them on but using MINSCALEDENOM
  and MAXSCALEDENOM to determine at what zoomlevels the layer is available. If
  a map's display is outside of the layer's MINSCALEDENOM and MAXSCALEDENOM
  range, then MapServer can skip processing that layer. It also makes for a
  really cool effect, that the national boundaries magically change to state
  boundaries.

- If you have a complex application, consider using multiple simple and
  specific mapfiles in place of one large 'do everything' mapfile.

- In a similar vein, each class also supports MINSCALEDENOM and MAXSCALEDENOM.
  If your dataset has data that are relevant at different zoomlevels, then you
  may find this a very handy trick. For example, give a MINSCALEDENOM of
  1:1000000, county roads a MINSCALEDENOM of 1:100000, and streets a
  MAXSCALEDENOM of 1:50000. You get the cool effect of new data magically
  appearing, but you don't have MapServer trying to draw the nation's roads
  when the entire nation is in view!

- Classes are processed in order, and a feature is assigned to the first class
  that matches. So try placing the most commonly-used classes at the top of
  the class list, so MapServer doesn't have to try as many classes before
  finding a match. For example, if you wanted to highlight the single state of
  Wyoming, you would probably do this:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    CLASS
       EXPRESSION ('[NAME]' eq 'WY'])
       STYLE
         COLOR 255 0 0
       END
    END
    CLASS
       STYLE
       COLOR 128 128 128
       END
    END

But it would be a lot more efficient to do this, since 98% of cases will be
matched on the first try:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   CLASS
     EXPRESSION ('[NAME]' ne 'WY'])
     STYLE
       COLOR 128 128 128
     END
   END
   CLASS
     STYLE
       COLOR 255 0 0
     END
   END

- Use :ref:`tile indexes <tileindex>` instead of multiple layers.

8. Yes Data Formats Matter
--------------------------

This is often not written in documents, yet is often taught in hands-on 
workshops (as maybe readers or developers can be reading the document here
and become offended if it differs in their thinking or the purpose of
their software design, as some formats may be deemed 'uncool' by some crowds, 
but in reality, we don't care about coolness here, we care about making MapServer 
fast).  So the following advice is by the authors of this 
document (disclaimer), and may offend some readers, therefore 'viewer discretion 
is advised'.

Although MapServer can read any GDAL supported `vector <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html>`__ 
or `raster <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html>`__ source (and the 
fact that not all users will be setting up tile caching beforehand), the following
is still recommended for MapServer for optimal performance in terms of data formats.

**Optimization Suggestions**

- The best/optimal data sources for MapServer in terms of speed-of-display
  is `.shp <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/shapefile.html#vector-shapefile>`__ 
  (for vectors) and `GeoTIFF <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/gtiff.html>`__ 
  (for rasters).
- For databases, MapServer displays `PostGIS <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/pg.html>`__ 
  layers very fast, and some custom tricks are included in the MapServer source 
  specifically for PostGIS + MapServer draw speed.  PostGIS is therefore recommended.
- `SpatiaLite <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/sqlite.html>`__ is recommended
  for those who require a portable format, and works very well with MapServer.
- For whatever formats you choose, definitely review the associated GDAL format 
  (driver) page for that specific format, and enable indexing (spatial or also attribute
  indexing).
- Rasters, and of course GeoTIFFs, should also have overviews included, through the
  `gdaladdo <https://gdal.org/programs/gdaladdo.html>`__ utility.
- Raster layers can also include various :ref:`PROCESSING directives <raster_processing_directives>`, 
  specific to raster display in MapServer (such as displaying specific bands, or choosing a 
  resampling method, but for resampling do experiment with the fastest display option 
  versus display quality).
- If you do use .shp files (and many still do) you must always enable fast quadtree
  index lookups in MapServer through the :ref:`shptree` utility.
- Wherever possible, making your source dataset as lightweight as possible, will
  assist MapServer in processing your data (for vectors, this could mean removing
  unused data fields).
- As mentioned earlier, if you must display various rasters or vectors as a 'mosaic'
  together, implement :ref:`tileindex`, to implement the mosaic as a single layer
  in MapServer.
- GDAL's virtual format (VRT) is very 
  powerful also for mosaicing or transforming data on-demand, and has specific VRT
  driver instructions for `vector <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/vrt.html>`__
  and `raster <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/vrt.html#raster-vrt>`__ .
- There are times when splitting .shp files (shapefiles) into smaller files, make it
  more efficient to display in MapServer; the `shp2tile <https://github.com/woodbri/imaptools.com>`__
  utility is a wonderful commandline tool for this.
  
.. NOTE::
    For Windows users, `MS4W <https://ms4w.com>`__ includes the shp2tile utility, and 
    all utilities mentioned above.

9. Enable Caching through MapCache
----------------------------------

If your mapfile serves any OGC-related service (such as WMS, WFS, etc.) you should 
consider enabling :ref:`MapCache <mapcache>`, an Apache module, for your services. Caching 
common map results (as an image file, or inside a SQLite db for example) for common
map extents, will obviously drastically improve speed, and cancel-out any format 
discussions/benefits/arguments mentioned above.

10. Symbols
-----------

When the mapfile is loaded, each raster symbol listed in the symbols file is
located on the filesystem and loaded.

**Optimization Suggestions**

- Only include raster symbols in your symbols file if you know that they will
  be used by your application.

.. index::
   pair: Optimization; Fonts

11. Fonts
---------

To load a font, MapServer opens up a lookup file (often named fonts.list or fonts.txt) 
:ref:`fontset` which contains an alias for the font and the path for that font file. If you have a
fonts.list file with a long list of fonts, it will take more time for
MapServer to locate and load the font that you need.

**Optimization Suggestions**

- Limit the entries in fonts.list to fonts that you actually use. 

12. Use MapScript
-----------------

MapScript, in your favorite language such as PHP or Python, can be used to manipulate 
mapfiles on-the-fly.  Some common use cases are:

- adding a layer into an existing mapfile
- modifying an existing layer
- generating a new mapfile/service on-demand

The options here are limitless, for what you can do with MapScript.  The full list
of available parameters and functions (methods) are listed in the :ref:`swig`.

13. Don't expose your MAP path
------------------------------

This is more obvious if your mapfile serves OGC services, such as set in the 
*wms_onlineresource* metadata parameter in your WEB object, which by default 
must contain the *MAP=path/to/your/mapfile*, but exposing paths on your public
server can open you to possible malicious attacks on your filesystem.  You should 
take some time to review the possible steps in the document :ref:`limit_mapfile_access`.

At the minimum, you should enable the *MS_MAPFILE* :ref:`environment variable <environment_variables>` 
so that your CGI mapserv requests, and your onlineresource OGC requests, do not require
a visible MAP= path.  The WMS Server document has several :ref:`examples <online_resource_wms>` 
of how to enable these environment variables.
