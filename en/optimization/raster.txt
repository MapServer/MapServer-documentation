Choose the right raster format for your needs
---------------------------------------------

The best/optimal data sources for MapServer in terms of speed-of-display
is `GeoTIFF <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/gtiff.html>`__ for rasters.

Here are some other points to consider:

- The GeoTIFF image format is the fastest to "decipher", but once you get beyond a
  certain point, the disk reading may become slow
  enough to make it worthwhile to consider other image formats.

- For GeoTIFFs larger than 1 GB, ECW images tend to render faster than GeoTIFFs, since
  decompressing the data (CPU and RAM) is faster than reading the uncompressed
  data (disk). The downside is that ECW is not open-source, and the licensing is
  often prohibitive.  `MrSID <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/mrsid.html#raster-mrsid>`__ 
  is another compressed image format that can be used.

- JPEG2000 is a very slow image format, as is JPEG.

Spend time to review GDAL's associated driver page for your chosen format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a critical step, as MapServer relies on GDAL for raster data access.  
Each driver (GDAL format) has its own set of abilities and switches. Find 
your raster format and review its options 
`here <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html>`__.

Connect to your data through GDAL
---------------------------------

For data management in MapServer, this should always be one of your first steps.
Sometimes desktop GIS programs will display a format in a certain 
way but your data might not display in MapServer; checking
how GDAL reads your raster file, will help you manage and understand 
the data.  Here is an example using *gdalinfo* to read and return 
various important metadata regarding a specific raster, in this case a
MrSID raster: ::

  gdalinfo ortho_1-1_hc_s_mn163_2019_1.sid
  
        Driver: MrSID/Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database (MrSID)
        Files: ortho_1-1_hc_s_mn163_2019_1.sid

.. NOTE::
    You can use the extent values returned from gdalinfo (using Lower Left and
    Upper Right values) to paste into your
    mapfile's EXTENT parameter.  You can also notice in that summary
    the *PROJCS/AUTHORITY* line, which states that this data is currently
    in the `EPSG:26915 <http://epsg.io/26915>`__ projection. 

.. NOTE::
    For Windows users, `MS4W <https://ms4w.com>`__ includes the gdalinfo utility, 
    and all utilities mentioned here.    

Overviews
---------

GeoTIFF supports the creation of "overviews" within the file, which is basically a
downsampled version of the raster data suitable for use at lower resolutions.
Use the `gdaladdo <https://gdal.org/programs/gdaladdo.html>`__ program to add overviews 
to a GeoTIFF, and MapServer (via GDAL)
will automagically choose which downsampled layer to use. Note that overviews
significantly increase the disk space required by a GeoTIFF, and in some cases the
extra disk reading may offset the performance gained by MapServer not having to
resample the image. You'll just have to try it for yourself and see how it
works.

Tileindexes and Internal Tiling
-------------------------------

Tiling is mostly effective for cases where one commonly requests only a very
small area of the image. 

A tileindex is how one creates an on-the-fly mosaic from many rasters. This is
described in the :ref:`tileindex` MapServer document. That document describes 
common cases where a tileindex makes sense. In particular, if you have a very 
large raster and most requests are for a very small spatial area within it, 
you may want to consider slicing it and tileindexing it.

As an alternative to slicing and mosaicing, TIFFs do support a concept of
internal tiling. Like a tileindex, this is mostly effective when the requests
are for a small portion of the raster. Internal tiling is done by adding "-co
TILED=YES" to gdal_translate, e.g.:

:: 

    gdal_translate -co TILED=YES original.tif tiled.tif

Learn & Review the various GDAL utilities to manage your rasters
----------------------------------------------------------------

GDAL raster commandline utilities are very powerful, and the more processing 
that you can do offline, the faster and easier it will be for MapServer 
to display your raster.  For example, you might need a colorful 'shaded relief' 
from a raw DEM raster, in which case you could use the 
`gdaldem <https://gdal.org/programs/gdaldem.html>`__ utility, and then 
point your MapServer layer to that shaded relief raster.  Or you might 
want to reproject all of your rasters to the desired output/display projection 
beforehand, by using the `gdalwarp <https://gdal.org/programs/gdalwarp.html#gdalwarp>`__ 
utility.  Review all of the available GDAL raster utilities 
`here <https://gdal.org/programs/index.html#raster-programs>`__.
   
Handling your raster LAYERS in the mapfile
------------------------------------------

Please review the notes in the document :ref:`mapfile_tuning`.   

Remote WMS
----------

Some remote WMS/OGC services (as WMS actually returns an image from 
a request sent to a remote server) can be slow or unreliable. Optionally
you can use a monitoring service, such as 
`GeoHealthCheck <https://demo.geohealthcheck.org/resources?lang=en&resource_type=OGC%3AWMS>`__, 
to keep track of the service's reliability for you.

You can also consider when the remote WMS layer or remote service 
should be used.  For example, there may be a different WMS server 
(or a different set of imagery, or even vector outline maps) suitable 
for drawing the countries or states to orient the user. You could then 
have the WMS layer come on at a certain scale, or have the layer always 
available but turned off so the user can choose when to turn it on.
