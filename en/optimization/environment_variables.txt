Background
==========

A number of environment variables can be used to control MapServer's
behavior or specify the location of some resources.

.. TIP::
   In terms of GDAL, for a good list of GDAL's possible variables to use 
   (to help control data access in MapServer), see the 
   `GDAL wiki <https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/ConfigOptions>`__.
   The main GDAL site also has a `list <https://gdal.org/user/configoptions.html#list-of-configuration-options-and-where-they-apply>`__.

List of all possible MapServer Environment Variables
====================================================

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; CURL_CA_BUNDLE

CURL_CA_BUNDLE
   .. versionadded:: 5.4.1

   Used to specify the location of the Certificate
   Authority (CA) bundle file to be used by Curl when using HTTPS
   connections in WMS/WFS client layers. Curl comes bundled with its
   own CA bundle by default, so this variable is not required unless
   you have an unusual installation::

     export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/ca-bundle.crt

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_DEBUGLEVEL

MS_DEBUGLEVEL
   .. versionadded:: 5.0

   A default `DEBUG` level value can be set using the `MS_DEBUGLEVEL`
   environment variable in combination with the `MS_ERRORFILE`
   variable.

   When set, this value is used as the default debug level value for
   all map and layer objects as they are loaded by the mapfile parser.
   This option also sets the debug level for any msDebug() call
   located outside of the context of a map or layer object, for
   instance for debug statements relating to initialization before a
   map is loaded.  If a `DEBUG` value is also specified in the mapfile
   in some map or layer objects then the local value (in the mapfile)
   takes precedence over the value of the environment variable.

   This option is mostly useful when tuning applications by enabling
   timing/debug output before the map is loaded, to capture the full
   process initialization and map loading time, for instance.

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_ENCRYPTION_KEY

MS_ENCRYPTION_KEY
   .. versionadded:: 4.10 

   .. seealso:: :ref:`msencrypt <MSENCRYPT>`

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_ERRORFILE

MS_ERRORFILE
   The `MS_ERRORFILE` environment variable specifies the location of
   the logging/debug output, with possible values being either a file
   path on disk, or one of the following special values:

   * "stderr" to send output to standard error. Under Apache stderr is
     the Apache error_log file. Under IIS stderr goes to stdout so its
     use is discouraged. With IIS it is recommended to do direct output
     to a file on disk instead.

   * "stdout" to send output to standard output, combined with the
     rest of MapServer’s output.

   * "windowsdebug" to send output to the Windows OutputDebugString
     API, allowing the use of external programs like SysInternals
     debugview to display the debug output.

   It is possible to specify `MS_ERRORFILE` either as an environment
   variable or via a `CONFIG` directive inside a mapfile::

     CONFIG  "MS_ERRORFILE" "/tmp/mapserver.log"

   or::

     CONFIG  "MS_ERRORFILE" "stderr"

   If both the `MS_ERRORFILE` environment variable is set and a
   `CONFIG` `MS_ERRORFILE` is set, then the `CONFIG` directive takes
   precedence.

   If `MS_ERRORFILE` is not set, then error/debug logging is disabled.
   During parsing of a mapfile, error/debug logging may become
   available only after the `MS_ERRORFILE` directive has been parsed.

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_MAP_NO_PATH

MS_MAP_NO_PATH
   .. versionadded:: 5.4

   The `MS_MAP_NO_PATH` environment variable can be set to any value
   to forbid the use of explicit paths in the map=... URL parameter.
   Setting `MS_MAP_NO_PATH` to **any value** forces the use of the
   map=<env_variable_name> mechanism in mapserv CGI URLs.

   If this variable is not set then nothing changes and the mapserv
   CGI still accepts explicit file paths via the map=... URL
   parameter.

   Example, set set `MS_MAP_NOPATH` and some mapfile paths in Apache's
   httpd.conf::

     SetEnv MS_MAP_NO_PATH "foo"
     SetEnv MY_MAPFILE "/opt/mapserver/map1/mymapfile.map"

   and then calls the mapserv CGI must use environment variables for
   the map=... parameter::

     http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=MY_MAPFILE&mode=...

   .. seealso:: :ref:`limit_mapfile_access` & :ref:`rfc56`

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_MAPFILE

MS_MAPFILE
   The mapfile to use if the map=... URL parameter is not provided.

   It is also possible to use an environment variable name as the
   value of the map=... URL parameter.  The value of this environment
   variable will be used as the mapfile path::
   
     map=ENV_VAR


.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_MAPFILE_PATTERN

MS_MAPFILE_PATTERN
   `MS_MAPFILE_PATTERN` can be used to override the default regular
   expression which is used to validate mapfile filename extensions.

   The default value for this variable is::

     MS_MAPFILE_PATTERN='\.map$'
     
.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_MAP_BAD_PATTERN

MS_MAP_BAD_PATTERN
   .. versionadded:: 7.6.3
   
   The `MS_MAP_BAD_PATTERN` environment variable can be used to specify a
   Regular Expression to catch & not allow problematic character sequences 
   in any mapfile paths passed to the mapserv CGI in the map=... URL parameter.
   If the value matches then an error is generated.  By default all 
   MapServer installations (since 7.6.3) set a hardcoded value for 
   *MS_MAP_BAD_PATTERN* of:
   ::

    [/\\]{2}|[/\\]?\\.+[/\\]|,
  
   which will therefore not allow "/../" or "//" in the map value.

   For Windows users, MS4W uses the PCRE regex library (which requires a 
   slightly different regex syntax), so all future MS4W releases will 
   contain the following default *MS_MAP_BAD_PATTERN* enabled 
   (to not allow "/../" or "//" in the map value) :
   
   ::
   
     [\/\\\\]{2}|[\/\\\\]?\.{2,}[\/\\\\]|,

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_MAP_PATTERN

MS_MAP_PATTERN
   .. versionadded:: 5.4

   The `MS_MAP_PATTERN` environment variable can be used to specify a
   Regular Expression that must be matched by all mapfile paths passed
   to the mapserv CGI in the map=... URL parameter.

   If `MS_MAP_PATTERN` is not set then any .map file can be loaded.

   Apache's SetEnv directive can be used to restrict mapfiles to a
   specific directory and subdirectories.
   
   * *Unix users* may set the following expression in Apache to restrict 
     mapfiles to the */opt/mapserver* directory and subdirectories:

     ::

       SetEnv MS_MAP_PATTERN "^\/opt\/mapserver\/([^\.][_A-Za-z0-9\-\.]+\/{1})*([_A-Za-z0-9\-\.]+\.(map))$" 
     
   * *Windows Apache/MS4W users* can set the following expression in the Apache
     conf file, to limit the possible MAP= paths to the common 
     *C:/ms4w/apps/* directory (where all MS4W mapfiles and applications live), 
     allow encoded urls, allow "." or "_" or "-" in MAP= paths but disallow ".." 
     directory traversing:

     ::

       SetEnv MS_MAP_PATTERN "^(C:)?\/ms4w\/apps\/((?!\.{2})[_A-Za-z0-9\-\.]+\/{1})*([_A-Za-z0-9\-\.]+\.(map))$"

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_MODE

MS_MODE
   Default value for the mode=... URL parameter. Setting mode=... in
   the URL takes precedence over the environment variable.

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_OPENLAYERS_JS_URL

MS_OPENLAYERS_JS_URL
   The URL to the OpenLayers javascript library (can be used when
   testing WMS services using imagetype application/openlayers),
   for instance::

     http://openlayers.org/api/OpenLayers.js

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_TEMPPATH

MS_TEMPPATH
   Set the :ref:`WEB` `TEMPPATH`.

   .. versionadded:: 6.0

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; MS_XMLMAPFILE_XSLT

MS_XMLMAPFILE_XSLT
   Used to enable XML Mapfile support.  Points to the location of the
   XSLT to use for the XML->text mapfile conversion.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`xml_mapfile`

.. index::
   pair: Environment variables; PROJ_LIB

PROJ_LIB
   The `PROJ_LIB` environment variable or `CONFIG` directive can be
   used to specify the directory where the PROJ data files are located
   (including the "proj.db" file, or "epsg" file for older PROJ versions), 
   if they are not in the default directory where PROJ expects them.
   
   .. NOTE::
      For the full list of possible PROJ variables to use see the  
      `official list <https://proj.org/usage/environmentvars.html>`__.
