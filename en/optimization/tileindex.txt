Introduction
------------
Tileindexes are MapServer's method for doing on-the-fly mosaicing.

What is a tileindex and how do I make one?
------------------------------------------

A tileindex is a dataset (usually a shapefile) that ties together several 
datasets into a single layer. Therefore, you don't need to create separate 
layers for each piece of imagery or each county's road data; make a tileindex 
and let MapServer piece the mosaic together on the fly.

Making a tileindex is easy using `gdaltindex <https://gdal.org/programs/gdaltindex.html>`__ 
for GDAL data sources (rasters) and `ogrtindex <https://gdal.org/programs/ogrtindex.html>`__ 
for OGR data sources (vectors). You just run them, specifying
the index file to create and the list of data sources to add to the index.

.. note::
    There is also the :ref:`tile4ms` utility, but it only handles shapefile
    mosaic/indexing.

.. index::
   single: gdaltindex

For example, to make a mosaic of several GeoTIFFs, creating an index file
named *tileindex-tif.shp*:

::

    gdaltindex tileindex-tif.shp folder/*.tif
    
.. index::
   single: ogrtindex

And to make a mosaic of vectors, creating an index file
named *tileindex-tiger.shp*:

::

    ogrtindex tileindex-tiger.shp tiger/CA/*.shp tiger/NV/*.shp
    
If your data files are in different subfolders, you can use the *--optfile* 
switch for `vectors <https://gdal.org/programs/vector_common_options.html#cmdoption-optfile>`__ 
or `rasters <https://gdal.org/programs/raster_common_options.html#raster-common-options-optfile>`__ 
to pass a file list to ogrtindex/gdaltindex, such as:

::

   #windows (create a file listing all .tif in subfolders)
   dir /s/b *.tif > tif_list.txt
   #unix
   find . -name "*.tif" > tif_list.txt
   
   #call gdaltindex with the --optfile switch
   gdaltindex gdaltindex-dirs.shp --optfile tif_list.txt
    
.. note::
    ogrtindex and gdaltindex **add** the specified files to the index.
    Sometimes you'll have to delete the index file to avoid creating duplicate
    entries.

.. index::
   pair: Optimization; TILEINDEX

Using the tileindex in your mapfile
-----------------------------------

Using a tileindex as a layer is best explained by an example:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME "Roads"
        STATUS ON
        TYPE LINE
        TILEINDEX "tiger/index.shp"
        TILEITEM "LOCATION"
    END   

There are two items of note here: :ref:`TILEINDEX <tileindex_keyword>` and
:ref:`TILEITEM <tileitem>`. TILEINDEX is simply
the path to the index file, and TILEITEM specifies the field in the shapefile
which contains the filenames referenced by the index. The TILEITEM will
usually be "LOCATION" unless you specified the *-tileindex* option when
running gdaltindex or ogrtindex.

Two important notes about the pathnames:
  
  * The path to TILEINDEX follows the same conventions as for any other data
    source, e.g. using the SHAPEPATH or else being relative to the location of
    the mapfile.
  * The filenames specified on the command line to gdaltindex or ogrtindex will
    be used with the same conventions as well, following the SHAPEPATH or else
    being relative to the mapfile's location. You might find it useful to change
    into the SHAPEPATH directory and then run ogrtindex/gdaltindex from there;
    this ensures correct pathnames.
  
Tileindexes may make your map faster
------------------------------------

A tileindex is often a performance boost for two reasons: 
  
  * It's more efficient than having several separate layers. 
  * MapServer will examine the tileindex to determine which datasets fall into
    the map's view, and will open only those datasets. This can result in a
    great savings for a large dataset, especially for use cases where most of
    the time only a very small spatial region of the data is being used. (for
    example, citywide maps with nationwide street imagery)
    
.. TIP::
   You can also run :ref:`shptree` on your tileindex file, so that MapServer
   can locate the associated feature/record faster.   
  
A tileindex will not help in the case where all/most of the data sources will
usually be opened anyway (e.g. street data by county, showing states or larger
regions). In that case, it may even result in a decrease in performance, since
it may be slower to open 100 files than to open one giant file.

The ideal case for a tileindex is when the most typically requested map areas
fall into very few tiles. For example, if you're showing state and larger
regions, try fitting your data into state-sized blocks instead of county-sized
blocks; and if you're showing cities and counties, go for county-sized blocks.

You'll just have to experiment with it and see what works best for your use
cases.

.. _tileindex_mixed_srs:

Tileindexes with tiles in different projections
-----------------------------------------------

Starting with MapServer 6.4 for raster layers, and MapServer 7.2 for vector
layers, a tileindex can contain rasters/layers in
different projections. Such tileindex can be generated with 
`gdaltindex <https://gdal.org/programs/gdaltindex.html>`__ (GDAL
1.11 or later) and `ogrtindex <https://gdal.org/programs/ogrtindex.html>`__ 
(GDAL 2.2 or later), with the -t_srs and -src_srs_name options. The -t_srs instructs
gdaltindex/ogrtindex to write the envelope of each tile into a common target
projection, so that the geometries written in the tile index are consistent.
This common projection must be the projection of the raster/vector layer.

::

    gdaltindex -t_srs EPSG:4326 -src_srs_name src_srs imagery.shp imagery/*.tif

The corresponding LAYER definition will need to specify the
:ref:`TILESRS <tilesrs>` keyword with the value of the -src_srs_name option.

e.g:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME "My Imagery"
        STATUS ON
        TYPE RASTER
        TILEINDEX "imagery.shp"
        TILEITEM "LOCATION"
        TILESRS "src_srs"
        PROJECTION
            AUTO
            # or :
            # "+init=EPSG:4326"
        END
    END 

MapServer will then be able to proceed to on-the-fly mosaicing and reprojection.

Note for WCS layers
-------------------

For layers that must be exposed as WCS layers, a few metadata fields
("wcs_extent", "wcs_size", "wcs_resolution") must be specified in the LAYER
definition, so as to define a "virtual dataset" coverage (see :ref:`wcs_server`).
The GDAL wcs_virtds_params.py sample script can help generating those metadata
fields.

Long ogrtindex example
----------------------

This example uses TIGER Census data, where the data contains files
divided up by county. In this example we will show how to display
all lakes for the state of Minnesota.  The TIGER
Census data for Minnesota is made up of 85 different counties, each
containing its own lakes file ('xxxx_areawater.shp').

**Figure 1: County lake files displayed in QGIS**

.. image:: ../images/tileindex-qgis-shps.png
    :width: 800
    :height: 433
    :class: no-scaled-link

Our directory structure looks like the following ('tiger2020' contains
the 85 shapefiles):

::

  - mainfolder
     - data
       - tiger2020
     - tileindex.map
       
1. We need to generate the index file with ogrtindex.  First we will change
   directory into the *data* folder, so that the index file is generated there,
   then execute ogrtindex:
   
   ::
   
     cd data
     ogrtindex lakes-ogrtindex.shp tiger2020/*.shp
     
2. We can now load that new index file *lakes-ogrtindex.shp* into QGIS to 
   examine it.
   
   **Figure 2: Index file created by ogrtindex utility**

   .. image:: ../images/tileindex-qgis-shps-index.png
       :width: 800   
       :height: 436
       :class: no-scaled-link
       
   **Figure 3: Attributes of index file created by ogrtindex utility**

   .. image:: ../images/tileindex-qgis-shps-index-attributes.png
       :width: 595   
       :height: 567
       :class: no-scaled-link

.. note::
    Notice the relative paths in the LOCATION field, which is the default
    (and recommended) for ogrtindex.   If you need full/absolute paths you 
    can use the *-write_absolute_path* switch. 

3. A protip is to then run :ref:`shptree` on the ogrtindex file and all
   of the .shp files used, so MapServer can access them quickly.

   ::
   
     cd data
     #windows command:
     for /R %f in (*.shp) do shptree %f
     #unix command:
     find /path/to/data -name "*.shp" -exec shptree {} \;

   You should now see associated *.qix* files created for each shapefile.

4. The final step is to use this in your mapfile.

   - LAYER object's TILEINDEX - must point to the location of the
     index file
   - LAYER object's TILEITEM - specify the name of the field in the
     index file containing the paths (default is 'location')
   - do not need to use the LAYER's DATA parameter
   - the location path inside your tileindex file will be relative to
     the SHAPEPATH, as shown below:

   For example:
   
   .. code-block:: mapfile

        MAP
          NAME "tileindex-map"
          STATUS ON
          SIZE 600 400
          SYMBOLSET "../etc/symbols.txt"
          EXTENT -99.99 43.13 -86.70 49.60
          UNITS DD
          SHAPEPATH "./data"
          IMAGECOLOR 255 255 255
          FONTSET "../etc/fonts.txt"
          PROJECTION
            "init=epsg:4269"
          END # projection 

          /* Lakes: Tiger Census 2020 */
          LAYER
            NAME "lakes"
            TYPE POLYGON
            STATUS OFF
            TILEITEM "LOCATION"  
            TILEINDEX "lakes-ogrtindex.shp"
            PROJECTION
              "init=epsg:4269"
            END # projection 
            CLASS
              NAME "Lakes"
              STYLE
                COLOR 134 204 249
              END # style
            END # class
          END # layer 

        END # Map File
        
5. And of course use :ref:`shp2img` to generate your map image.

   ::
   
     shp2img -m tileindex.map -o ttt.png -map_debug 3
     
   .. image:: ../images/tileindex-lakes.png
       :width: 600   
       :height: 400
       :class: no-scaled-link
       
   When you view the layer in a MapServer application, you will notice 
   that when you are zoomed into a small area of the state (such as 
   a single county) only the necessary lake shapefiles are loaded, 
   which speeds up the application.       
       
Long gdaltindex example
-----------------------

This example uses NAIP ortho imagery, for counties in the 
state of Minnesota.  The format is MrSID.  Since the data is 
so large, for this exercise 6 counties were used (so 6 MrSID
raster files).  An example filename in this case is
*ortho_xxxx.sid*

**Figure 1: MrSID imagery displayed in QGIS**

.. image:: ../images/tileindex-qgis-mrsid.png
    :width: 800
    :height: 433
    :class: no-scaled-link

Our directory structure looks like the following ('naip2019' contains
the 6 MrSID images):

::

  - mainfolder
     - data
       - naip2019
     - tileindex.map
       
1. We need to generate the index file with gdaltindex.  First we will change
   directory into the *data* folder, so that the index file is generated there,
   then execute gdaltindex:
   
   ::
   
     cd data
     gdaltindex naip-imagery-gdaltindex.shp naip2019/*.sid
     
2. We can now load that new index file *naip-imagery-gdaltindex.shp* into QGIS to 
   examine it.
   
   **Figure 2: Index file created by gdaltindex utility**

   .. image:: ../images/tileindex-qgis-mrsid-index.png
       :width: 800   
       :height: 436
       :class: no-scaled-link
       
   **Figure 3: Attributes of index file created by gdaltindex utility**

   .. image:: ../images/tileindex-qgis-mrsid-index-attributes.png
       :width: 448  
       :height: 342
       :class: no-scaled-link

.. note::
    Notice the relative paths in the LOCATION field, which is the default
    (and recommended) for gdaltindex.   If you need full/absolute paths you 
    can use the *-write_absolute_path* switch. 

3. A protip is to then run :ref:`shptree` on the gdaltindex file so 
   MapServer can access it quickly.

   ::
   
     cd data
     shptree naip-imagery-gdaltindex.shp

   You should now see a *.qix* file created.

4. The final step is to use this in your mapfile.

   - LAYER object's TILEINDEX - must point to the location of the
     index file
   - LAYER object's TILEITEM - specify the name of the field in the
     index file containing the paths (default is 'location')
   - do not need to use the LAYER's DATA parameter
   - the location path inside your tileindex file will be relative to
     the SHAPEPATH, as shown below:

   For example:
   
   .. code-block:: mapfile

        MAP
          NAME "tileindex-map"
          STATUS ON
          SIZE 600 400
          SYMBOLSET "../etc/symbols.txt"
          EXTENT -99.99 43.13 -86.70 49.60
          UNITS DD
          SHAPEPATH "./data"
          IMAGECOLOR 255 255 255
          FONTSET "../etc/fonts.txt"
          PROJECTION
            "init=epsg:4269"
          END # projection 

          /* Ortho imagery: NAIP 2019 */
          LAYER
            NAME "ortho"
            TYPE RASTER
            STATUS ON
            TILEITEM "LOCATION"  
            TILEINDEX "naip-imagery-gdaltindex.shp"
            PROJECTION
              "init=epsg:26915"
            END # projection 
          END # layer

        END # Map File
        
5. And of course use :ref:`shp2img` to generate your map image.

   ::
   
     shp2img -m tileindex.map -o ttt.png -map_debug 3
     
   .. image:: ../images/tileindex-mrsid.png
       :width: 600   
       :height: 400
       :class: no-scaled-link

   When you view the layer in a MapServer application, you will notice 
   that when you are zoomed into a small area of the state 
   (such as a single county) only the necessary MrSID images are loaded, 
   which speeds up the application.
