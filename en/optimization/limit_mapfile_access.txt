The MapServer CGI, by default, will happily attempt to process any mapfile it is 
asked to. While this might be desireable in a development environment, it is not 
acceptable for public-facing installations. MapServer supports the use of specific
**environment variables**, set at the web server tier, to limit access. Since 
the MapServer 7.6.3 release, you are **required** to use (a combination of) 
these environment variables to secure your installation; for earlier MapServer 
versions these environment variables are **strongly recommended**.

.. warning:: 
    The vulnerability `CVE-2021-32062 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32062>`_
    was fixed through the MapServer 7.6.3 release, through requiring the use of
    the environment variables described in this MapServer document.

.. note:: 
    Environment variables are only referenced by the MapServer CGI and are not 
    used by MapScript in any way.

Key Environment Variables
=========================

.. seealso:: :ref:`environment_variables`
.. seealso:: :ref:`rfc56`
.. seealso:: Associated `Pull Request <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/pull/6314>`_ for the 7.6.3 release

.. tip:: 
    The online tools `RegExr <https://regexr.com/>`__ & `RegEx101 <https://regex101.com/>`__ 
    are great for testing regular expressions. 

**MS_MAP_BAD_PATTERN**

.. versionadded:: 7.6.3

If set, this environment variable is interpreted as regular expression that is used 
to test the value of the CGI map parameter, by specifying which problematic 
character sequences to avoid. If the value matches then an error is 
generated.  By default all MapServer installations (since 7.6.3) set a 
hardcoded value for *MS_MAP_BAD_PATTERN* of:
::

  [/\\]{2}|[/\\]?\\.+[/\\]|,
  
which will therefore not allow "/../" or "//" in the map value.

.. note:: 
    For Windows users, MS4W uses the PCRE regex library (which requires a 
    slightly different regex syntax), so all future MS4W releases will 
    contain the following default *MS_MAP_BAD_PATTERN* enabled 
    (to not allow "/../" or "//" in the map value) :
    
    ::
    
      [\/\\\\]{2}|[\/\\\\]?\.{2,}[\/\\\\]|,
      
    For more information see `Securing your MS4W Installation <https://ms4w.com/README_INSTALL.html#securing-your-ms4w-installation>`_
  

**MS_MAP_NO_PATH**

.. versionadded:: 5.4.0

If set, this environment variable limits values for the CGI map parameter to a 
curated (prepared) set of mapfiles explicitly defined by additional environment 
variables. This is the recommended way to secure mapfile access if at all possible. 

.. note:: 
   Mapfile-based environment variables (such as *MS_MAPFILE*) can be used without 
   setting MS_MAP_NO_PATH.
 
**MS_MAP_PATTERN**

.. versionadded:: 5.4.0
 
If set, this environment variable is interpreted as regular expression that is used 
to test the value of the CGI map parameter. If the value does not match then 
an error is generated.

Care must be taken to craft regular expressions that limit access to specific, 
trusted directories and limit path traversal:. See the :ref:`environment_variables` 
guide for examples.  

.. note:: 
    If defined, the MS_MAP_PATTERN variable only applies to mapfiles not 
    already defined through an environment variable.
 
Setting Environment Variables
=============================

Mechanisms to set environment variables vary from web server to web server, but all 
provide the capability. (regular expression feature sets can vary by operating system 
and version)

- **Apache** - https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/env.html

  Apache's `SetEnv <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_env.html#setenv>`__ 
  directive (available through the *mod_env* module) allows you to set 
  environment variables in the Apache conf file with a single command:

  * *Unix users* may set the following expression in Apache to restrict 
    mapfiles to the */opt/mapserver* directory and subdirectories:

    ::

      SetEnv MS_MAP_PATTERN "^\/opt\/mapserver\/([^\.][_A-Za-z0-9\-\.]+\/{1})*([_A-Za-z0-9\-\.]+\.(map))$" 
      
    .. warning:: 
        During testing during this documentation process, the above MS_MAP_PATTERN failed
        on an old Debian Wheezy server, on a valid path such as *MAP=/opt/mapserver/ogc-demos/wms.map*
        (the dash in the 'ogr-demos' folder caused much grief) even though the dash
        was escaped in the provided character set of the expression.

        Therefore those running older regex libs should use the following instead, which 
        puts the dash at the beginning of the character set of the expression, avoiding the
        escaping issue:

        SetEnv MS_MAP_PATTERN "^\/osgeo\/mapserver\/([^\.][-_A-Za-z0-9.]+\/{1})*([-_A-Za-z0-9.]+\.(map))$"        
    
  * *Windows Apache/MS4W users* can set the following expression in the Apache
    conf file, to limit the possible MAP= paths to the common 
    *C:/ms4w/apps/* directory (where all MS4W mapfiles and applications live), 
    allow encoded urls, allow "." or "_" or "-" in MAP= paths but disallow ".." 
    directory traversing:

    ::

      SetEnv MS_MAP_PATTERN "^(C:)?\/ms4w\/apps\/((?!\.{2})[_A-Za-z0-9\-\.]+\/{1})*([_A-Za-z0-9\-\.]+\.(map))$"
