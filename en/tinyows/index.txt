.. note::
  This documentation does not apply to the current release of MapServer. TinyOWS will be released as part of MapServer 6.2.

TinyOWS is a lightweight, fast implementation of the OGC
WFS-T specification. WFS-T allows map clients to write data back to
the map feature store. It has been used in Europe to allow farmers to
report the locations and crops on their fields.

TinyOWS is installed separately from MapServer's executable. Although
they are separate modules, both MapServer and TinyOWS use the same
.MAP configuration file. If you need only WFS capability, and not
WFS-T, you can use MapServer's built-in OGC implementations. See
:ref:`ogc` for details.
