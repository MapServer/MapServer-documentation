MapCache has the ability to forward any incoming request that it cannot
natively respond to (either by returning a tile directly, by :ref:`merging
<mapcache_tile_assembling>` multiple tiles, etc...).

This setup allows mapcache to be placed transparently in front of an existing
OGC-service supplying server to accelerate tiled or getmap requests for a
selected number of :ref:`grids <mapcache_grids>`, while maintaining service
compatibility for, e.g., unsupported grids, WFS requests, ...

.. note::

  The proxying of requests is configured inside the :ref:`WMS <mapcache_wms>`
  MapCache service, which is semantically awkward.

The configuration for this behavior is activated by a succession of entries
inside the <forwarding_rule> element of the wms <service>. Rules are tested
for in the order in which they appear in the mapcache.xml configuration file,
and the first one that matches is used. If no rules are defined, or if no
rule matches the incoming request, an error is returned to the user.

.. code-block:: xml
   <service type="wms" enabled="true">
      <forwarding_rule name="first rule">
         <!-- rule tests -->
         <!-- proxy destination -->
      </forwarding_rule>
      <forwarding_rule name="second rule">
         <!-- rule tests -->
         <!-- proxy destination -->
      </forwarding_rule>
   </service>


A <forwarding_rule> consists of a set of matching rules and an <http> block
defining where the request should be forwarded to.

Parameter Filtering
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rules apply to the KVP parameters that were passed in the incoming request,
and are added with the <param> keyword:

.. code-block:: xml
   
   <forwarding_rule name="first rule">
     <param name="SERVICE" type="values">WFS,WCS</param>
     <!-- ... !>
   <forwarding_rule>

The "type" attribute is the same that what is allowed for :ref:`dimensions
<mapcache_dimensions>`, i.e. allowed values are "values", "regex", and
"intervals". In the previous example, the rule would match any incoming
request having ...&SERVICE=WFS&... or ...&SERVICE=WCS&... in its request
parameters.

.. code-block:: xml
  
   <forwarding_rule name="first rule">
     <param name="SERVICE" type="values">WFS,WCS</param>
     <param name="LAYERS" type="values">somelayername</param>
     <!-- ... !>
   <forwarding_rule>

Multiple rules can be used if the filtering has to be done on mutiple
parameters. In the previous example, the rule would match a WFS or WCS
request that concerns the "somelayername" layer only.

A <forwarding_rule> that has no <param> child will match any incoming
request that could not be serviced by MapCache directly from its cache,
and can be used to forward all unsupported request to a full OGC
compliant server so that an un-cached response can be returned to the
client.

Proxy Destination
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once a <forwarding_rule> matches, its <http> child will be used to proxy the
request to another server.
   
.. code-block:: xml
  
   <forwarding_rule name="first rule">
     <!-- ... !>
     <http>
        <url>http://wmsserver/ogc.cgi?</url>
     </http>
   <forwarding_rule>
