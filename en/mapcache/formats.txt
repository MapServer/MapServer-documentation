MapCache allows you to configure how the image should be saved to a cache once
it has been requested from a source. The JPEG format should mostly be used for
raster imagery, whereas the PNG format is most usefull for vector based imagery
where there are large uniform areas.

.. _mapcache_jpeg_format:

JPEG Format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JPEG format saves tiles to jpeg, you can configure the JPEG compression
level (from 1 to 100) and the colorspace that should be used (rgb or ycbcr)

.. code-block:: xml
   
   <format name="myjpeg" type="JPEG">
      <quality>85</quality>
      <photometric>ycbcr</photometric>
   </format>

- *quality*: this is the typical jpeg quality setting. Values under 50 produce
  lighter images but with notable compression artifacts. 100 should be avoided
  as it produces very heavy images
- *photometric*: By default the YCbCr colorspace is used as it produces images
  that tend to be 2 to 3 times lighter. Use rgb if you don't want the default.

.. _mapcache_png_format:

PNG Format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PNG format creates PNG images, with optional quantization (reduction of
the number of colors to create an 8bit paletted PNG)

.. code-block:: xml
   
   <format name="mypng" type="PNG">
      <compression>fast</compression>
      <colors>256</colors>
   </format>

- *compression*: choose which zlib compression to apply to the image data.
  Recognized values are "fast" and "best". Omit the key to use the default
  zlib compression.
- *colors*: number of colors to use for quantization. Ommit this key to
  produce 24 or 32 bit RGB/RGBA pngs, or set to a value between 2 and 256
  to create an 8-bit paletted png. The quantization step is destructive, 
  there is no guarantee that pixels will not have a noticable shift in color
  in the case when the tile contains many colors.

.. _mapcache_mixed_format:

Mixed Format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a third special format which mixes JPEG and PNG compression depending
on the contents of the image. This format allows to create caches for raster
imagery using JPEG compression (which is more efficient) on zones with imagery
data, and PNG compression (which supports trasnparency) on zones with no 
imagery or on a boundary between imagery and emptiness.

.. code-block:: xml
   
   <format name="mymixed" type="MIXED">
      <opaque>myjpeg</opaque>
      <transparent>mypng</transparent>
   </format>

- *opaque*: the format to use when the image has only fully opaque pixels
- *transparent*: the format to use if when the image has some transparent or
  semi-opaque pixels.
