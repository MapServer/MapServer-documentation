Configuration File

The configuration file determines how mod-mapcache will serve incoming requests.
It is an XML file comprising a list of entries, as outlined here:

.. code-block:: xml

   <mapcache>
      <grid>....</grid>
      <source>....</source>
      <cache>...</cache>
      <format>...</format>
      <tileset>...</tileset>
      <services>...</services>
   </mapcache>


.. _mapcache_config_source:


Source
================================================================================

A source is a service mod-mapcache can query to obtain image data. This is
typically a WMS server accessible by a URL. (There are currently no sources
other than WMS implemented, though others may be added later if the need
arises).

.. code-block:: xml

   <source name="vmap0" type="wms">

      <!--
         Extra parameters that will be added to the GetMap request. You can
         specify any parameter here, e.g. VERSION if you want to override the
         version of the WMS request.

         The LAYERS parameter is mandatory.

         Usual parameters here are FORMAT, or MAP if using MapServer.
      -->
      <getmap>
         <params>
            <FORMAT>image/png</FORMAT>
            <LAYERS>basic</LAYERS>
         </params>
      </getmap>

      <!-- HTTP URL and parameters to be used when making WMS requests -->
      <http>

         <!-- URL of the WMS service, without any parameters -->
         <url>http://vmap0.tiles.osgeo.org/wms/vmap0</url>

         <!--
            HTTP headers added to the request. Make sure you know what you are
            doing when adding headers here, as they take precedence over any
            default headers curl will be adding to the request.

            Typical headers that can be added here are User-Agent and Referer.

            When adding a <key>value</key> element here, the request to the WMS
            source will contain the

            key: value\r\n

            HTTP header.

            You may also forward a header from the incoming client request using
            the <MyHeader>{X-Header-To-Forward}<MyHeader> syntax.
         -->
         <headers>
            <User-Agent>mod-mapcache/r175</User-Agent>
            <Referer>http://www.mysite.com?param=2&amp;par=4</Referer>
         </headers>

         <!-- Timeout in seconds before bailing out from a request -->
         <connection_timeout>30</connection_timeout>
      </http>
   </source>

* The name and type attributes are straightforward: `type` is "wms", and `name`
* is the key by which this source will be referenced; `<url>` is the HTTP
* location where the service can be accessed; and `<wmsparams>` is a list of
* parameters that will be added to the WMS request. You should probably at the
* very least add the FORMAT and LAYERS parameters. By convention(?), WMS
* parameters are uppercase, and you should respect this convention in your
* configuration file.
*
* This is where you can also override some default WMS parameters if needed. By
* default, the parameters that will be used are: `<REQUEST>GetMap</REQUEST>`
* `<SERVICE>WMS</SERVICE>` `<STYLES></STYLES>` `<VERSION>1.1.0</VERSION>`

Cache
================================================================================

A cache is a location where received tiles will be stored.

.. code-block:: xml

   <cache name="disk" type="disk">

      <!-- base

           Absolute filesystem path where the tile structure will be stored.

           This directory needs to be readable and writable by the user running
           Apache.
      -->
      <base>/tmp</base>

      <!-- symlink_blank

           Enable blank (i.e. uniform color) tile detection. Blank tiles will be
           detected at creation time and linked to a single blank tile on disk
           to preserve disk space.
      -->
      <symlink_blank/>
   </cache>

   <cache name="tmpl" type="disk" layout="template">
      <!-- template

           String template that will be used to map a tile (by tileset, grid
           name, dimension, format, x, y, and z) to a filename on the filesystem.

           The following replacements are performed:

           - {tileset}               : the tileset name
           - {grid}                  : the grid name
           - {dim}                   : string concatenating the tile's dimension
           - {ext}                   : tile's image-format filename extension
           - {x},{y},{z}             : tile's x,y,z values
           - {inv_x},{inv_y},{inv_z} : inverted x,y,z values
                                       
           (For inverted x,y,z values, (inv_x = level->maxx - x - 1). This is
           mainly used to support grids where one axis is inverted (e.g. the
           Google schema) and you want to create on offline cache.)

         * Note that this type of cache does not support blank-tile detection
           and symlinking.

         * Warning: It is up to you to make sure that the template you choose
           creates a unique filename for your given tilesets (e.g. do not ommit
           the {grid} parameter if your tilesets reference multiple grids.)
           Failure to do so will result in filename collisions!

      -->
      <template>/tmp/template-test/{tileset}#{grid}#{dim}/{z}/{x}/{y}.{ext}</template>
   </cache>

   <!-- memcache cache

        Entry accepts multiple <server> entries.

        Requires a fairly recent apr-util library and headers.
   -->
   <cache name="memcache" type="memcache">
      <server>
         <host>localhost</host>

   </cache>

   <!-- sqlite cache

        Requires building with "with-sqlite".
   -->
   <cache name="sqlite" type="sqlite3">
      <!-- dbfile

           Absolute filename path of the SQLite database file to use.
   
           This file needs to be readable and writable by the user running the
           MapCache instance.

   </cache>

   <cache name="mbtiles" type="mbtiles">
      <dbfile>/path/to/MapBox/tiles/natural-earth-1.mbtiles</dbfile>
   </cache>


Format
================================================================================

A format is an image format that will be used to return tile data to clients,
and to store tile data on disk.

.. code-block:: xml

   <format name="PNGQ_FAST" type ="PNG">

      <!-- compression

           PNG compression: best or fast

           Note that "best" compression is CPU intensive for little gain over
           the default default compression obtained by leaving out this tag.
      -->
      <compression>fast</compression>

      <!-- colors

           If supplied, this enables PNG quantization which reduces the number
           of colors in an image to attain higher compression. This operation is
           destructive, and can cause artifacts in the stored image.

           The number of colors can be between 2 and 256.
     -->
     <colors>256</colors>
   </format>
   <format name="myjpeg" type ="JPEG">

      <!-- quality

           JPEG compression quality, ranging from 0 to 100.

           95 produces high quality images with few visual artifacts. Values
           under around 80 produce small images but with visible artifacts.
           YMMV.
      -->
      <quality>75</quality>

      <!-- photometric

          Photometric interpretation of the bands created in the JPEG image.

          Default is "ycbcr", which produces the smallest images. Can also be
          "rgb", which usually results in x2 or x3 image sizes.
      -->
      <photometric>ycbcr</photometric>

   </format>

   <format name="PNG_BEST" type ="PNG">
      <compression>best</compression>
   </format>

   <format name="mixed" type="MIXED">
      <transparent>PNG_BEST</transparent>
      <opaque>JPEG</opaque>
   </format>



.. _mapcache_grids:

Grid
================================================================================

A grid is the matrix that maps tiles onto an area, and consists of a spatial
reference, a geographic extent, resolutions, and tile sizes.

Mandatory Configuration Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **<size>**: The width and height of an individual tile, in pixels. Must be
  specified as positive integers separated by a space character. The most common
  tile size is:

  .. code-block:: xml

     <size>256 256</size>

* **<extent>**: The geographical extent covered by the grid, in ground units
  (e.g. meters, degrees, feet, etc.). Must be specified as 4 floating point
  numbers separated by spaces, ordered as minx, miny, maxx, maxy.

  MapCache expects all of its extents to be given in lonlat, and does the
  translation to latlon at request time if needed.

  The (minx,miny) point defines the origin of the grid, i.e. the pixel at the
  bottom left of the bottom-left most tile is always placed on the (minx,miny)
  geographical point.

  The (maxx,maxy) point is used to determine how many tiles there are for each
  zoom level.

  .. code-block:: xml

     <extent>-180 -90 180 90</extent>

* **<srs>**: The projection of the grid, usually given by it EPSG identifier.
  This value isn't used directly by MapCache to compute reprojections; it is
  only used to look up which grid to use when receiving WMS requests.

  .. code-block:: xml

     <srs>epsg:4326</srs>

  .. note::

    This is the value that is passed on to the :ref:`source <mapcache_sources>`
    when requesting a tile that is not already cached for the current grid. You
    must make sure that the source that is queried is capable of returning image
    data for this SRS.

* **<units>**: The ground units used by the grid's projection. This entry is not
  used directly by MapCache aside from calculating scales for the WMTS
  capabilities document. Allowed values are:

  * **m**  : meters
  * **dd** : decimal degrees
  * **ft** : feet

  .. code-block:: xml

     <units>dd</units>

* **<resolutions>**: This is a list of resolutions for each of the zoom levels
  defined by the grid. This must be supplied as a list of positive floating
  point values, separated by spaces and ordered from largest to smallest. The
  largest value will correspond to the grid's zoom level 0. Resolutions are
  expressed in "units-per-pixel", depending on the unit used by the grid (e.g.
  resolutions are in meters per pixel for most grids used in webmapping).

  .. code-block:: xml

    <resolutions>0.703125000000000 0.351562500000000 0.175781250000000 8.78906250000000e-2 4.39453125000000e-2 2.19726562500000e-2 1.09863281250000e-2 5.49316406250000e-3 2.74658203125000e-3 1.37329101562500e-3 6.86645507812500e-4 3.43322753906250e-4 1.71661376953125e-4 8.58306884765625e-5 4.29153442382812e-5 2.14576721191406e-5 1.07288360595703e-5 5.36441802978516e-6</resolutions>


Optional Configuration Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **<srsalias>**: This tag can be specified multiple times, and allows the user
  to add multiple SRS entries for a given grid. This is especially useful if
  the EPSG id for a given projection has evolved over time, or to support
  catalogs other than the EPSG one (which is the only catalog supported by the
  WMS specification).

  .. code-block:: xml

    <srs>EPSG:310024802</srs>
    <srsalias>IGNF:GEOPORTALFXX</srsalias>
    <srsalias>EPSG:310024001</srsalias>

* **<metadata>**:

  * **<title>**: The name of the grid, in human readable form. Appears in the
    capabilities documents.

    .. code-block:: xml

      <title>This grid covers the area blah blah blah</title>

  * **<WellKnownScaleSet>**: See the WMTS keyword. This will add a
    WellKnownScaleSet entry to the WMTS capabilities document. It is up to the
    user to make sure that the supplied resolutions for the grid actually match
    the pre-defined WellKnownScaleSet.

    .. code-block:: xml

      <WellKnownScaleSet>urn:ogc:def:wkss:OGC:1.0:GoogleCRS84Quad</WellKnownScaleSet>

* **<origin>**: Specifies the origin of the grid. Valid values are `top-left`,
  `bottom-left`, `top-right` and `bottom-right`.

  If not used, the grid will have the bottom-left corner as reference point.

  .. code-block:: xml

     <origin>top-left</origin>


Preconfigured Grids
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three predefined grids you can use without defining them in the
mapcache.xml file:

* The "WGS84" grid corresponds to a grid where the whole world is rendered on
  two 256x256-pixel tiles at level 0 (i.e. the (-180,-90,180,90) extent fits on
  a 512x256 image). It goes down to zoom level 17.

  .. code-block:: xml

     <grid name="WGS84">

     </grid>

* The "g" grid may be used to overlay tiles on top of GoogleMaps, and is the
  default tiling scheme used in webmapping applications. This grid goes down to
  zoom level 18. Level 0 is a single 256x256 tile. This grid's default SRS is
  EPSG:900913, which is non-standard but in wider use than than its official
  EPSG:3857 entry.

  .. code-block:: xml

.. _mapcache_config_tileset:

Tileset
================================================================================

A tileset is the essential configuration item for mod-mapcache, and corresponds
to a set of tiles coming from a *source*, stored in a *cache*, and returned to
the client in a given *format*.

.. code-block:: xml

   <tileset name="test">

      <!-- source

           The "name" attribute of a preconfigured <source>.
 
           If the tileset does not contain a <source> element, then it is
           considered read-only and its cache will never be updated. In this
           case, your seeder and webserver would have slightly different
           mapcache.xml files.

           Blank tiles may be dealt with by setting the <errors> directive to
           "empty_img".
      -->
      <source>vmap0</source>

      <!-- cache

           The "name" attribute of a preconfigured <cache>
      -->
      <cache>sqlite</cache>

      <!-- grid

           The "name" attribute of a preconfigured <grid>.

           You can also use the following notation to limit the area that will
           be cached and served to clients:

           <grid restricted_extent="-10 40 10 50">WGS84</grid>
         
           This is better than using a grid with a limited extent, as in this
           way the tiles that are already cached are not invalidated should you
           want to modify the restricted extent in the future. When using the
           restricted_extent attribute, you should give the corresponding
           information to the client that will be using the service.

           You can also limit the zoom levels that are cached/accessible by
           using the minzoom and maxzoom attributes.

           NOTE: When adding a <grid> element, you *MUST* make sure that the
           source you have selected is able to return images in the grid's SRS.
      -->
      <grid restricted_extent="-10 40 10 50" minzoom="4" maxzoom="17">WGS84</grid>
      <grid>g</grid>

      <!-- You may store hidden intermediate levels of tiles to enable higher
           quality output when reassembling tiles. This may be needed when
           caching maps containing labels to avoid the text from becoming too
           small or too blurry when requesting resolutions that are far away
           from the native grid resolutions.

           Supposing grid "mygrid" consists of 256x256 pixel tiles, with
           resolutions r1,r2,r3,r4,...rn, MapCache will populate a hidden grid
           called "mygrid_intermediate_0.5" containing tiles of size
           256+256*0.5=384 with resolutions r1+(r2-r1)*0.5, r2+(r3-r2)*0.5, ...
           r(n-1)+(r(n)-r(n-1)*0.5. That is, a tile with a given extent will be
           stored once in a 256x256 tile, and once in a 384x384 one.

           This intermediate grid is private to MapCache and will not be exposed
           to tiled requests. It will only be used for WMS requests that require
           horizontal assembling.
      -->
      <grid use_wms_intermediate_resolutions="true">mygrid</grid>

           Optional metadata tags used for responding to GetCapabilities
           requests. You can put anything here, but only the title and abstract
           tags are currently used to populate the GetCapabilities document.

      <!-- watermark

           Optional tag to add a watermark to the tiles *before* storing them to
           cache. The supplied image MUST be exactly the same size as the size
           as the tiles configured in the <grid>.

           The supplied image is read when the configuration is loaded. If you
           make changes to the image, they will NOT be reflected in tiles
           already stored in the cache, nor on newly stored tiles, until the
           server is restarted.
      -->
      <watermark>/path/to/static/watermark.png</watermark>

      <!-- format

          (Optional) format to use when storing a tile. This should be a format
          with high compression, e.g. PNG with compression "best", as the
          compression operation is only done once at tile creation time. If
          omitted, no recompression is applied to the image and mod-mapcache
          will store the exact image received from the <source>.
   
          Note that the <format> tag is mandatory if <metatile>, <metabuffer> or
          <watermark> are supplied, as in those cases recompression must be
          done.
      -->
      <format>PNG</format>

      <!-- metatile

           Number of columns and rows to use for metatiling. See
           http://geowebcache.org/docs/current/concepts/metatiles.html
      -->
      <metatile>5 5</metatile>

      <!-- metabuffer

           Area around the tile or metatile that will be cut off to prevent some
           edge artifacts. If this is specified, the configured source must be
           instructed not to put any labels inside this area, as otherwise
           labels will be truncated. (For MapServer, use the
           "labelcache_map_edge_buffer" "-10" metadata entry, along with label
           PARTIALS FALSE.)
      -->
      <metabuffer>10</metabuffer>

      <!-- expires

           Optional tile expiration value in seconds. This is expressed as
           number of seconds after creation date of the tile. This is the value
           that will be set in the HTTP Expires and Cache-Control headers, and
           has no effect on the actual expiration of tiles in the caches (see
           <auto_expire> for that).
      -->
      <expires>3600</expires>

      <!-- auto_expire

           Tiles older (in seconds) than this value will be re-requested and
           updated in the cache. Note that this will only delete tiles from the
           cache when they are accessed: You cannot use this configuration to
           limit the size of the created cache. Note that, if set, this value
           overrides the value given by <expires>.
      -->
      <auto_expire>86400</auto_expire>

      <!-- dimensions

           Optional dimensions that should be cached.
  
           The order of the <dimension> tags inside the <dimensions> block is
           important, as it is used to create the directory structure for the
           disk cache. That is, if you change the order of these values, any
           tiles that have been previously cached are invalidated: They are not
           removed from the cache, but they no longer exist for mod-mapcache.
      -->
      <dimensions>
         <!-- values dimension

              The example here creates a DIM1 dimension.

              * WMS and WMTS clients can now add a &DIM1=value to their request
                string. If they don't specify this key/value, the default will
                be to use DIM1=foobar.
              * The allowed values for DIM1= are foobar (it is important to add
                the default value to the allowed values entry), foobarbaz, foo
                and bar.
              * The value specified for DIM1 will be forwarded to the WMS
                source.
              * The produced tile will be stored in the file
                base/gridname/DIM1/value/xx/xx/xx/xx/xx/xx.png. That is, there
                are as many different caches created as there are values in the
                <values> tag.
         -->
         <dimension type="values" name="DIM1" default="foobar">foobar,foobarbaz,foo,bar</dimension>

         <!-- regex dimension
 
              The following creates a MAPFILE dimension, for using the same
              mod-mapcache tileset with different MapServer mapfiles. The name
              of the mapfiles need not be known to mod-mapcache, and can
              therefore be created even after mod-mapcache has been started.
            
              When a user passes a MAPFILE=/path/to/mapfile, the string
              "/path/to/mapfile" is validated against the supplied (PCRE)
              regular expression. The one in this example allows a name composed
              of aphanumeric characters separated by slashes (/) and ending in
              ".map" ( [a-zA-Z0-9\./]*\.map$ ), but will fail if there are two
              consecutive dots (..) in the path, to prevent filesystem traversal
              ( (?!.*\.\.) ).
         -->
         <dimension type="regex" name="MAPFILE" default="/path/to/mapfile.map">^(?!.*\.\.)[a-zA-Z0-9\./]*\.map$</dimension>

         <!-- intervals dimension

              The syntax is the same as common-ows, i.e. a comma-separated list
              of "min/max/resolution" entries, e.g:

              * 0/5000/1000 allows the values 0,1000,2000,3000,4000 and 5000.
              * 0/100/0 allows any values between 0 and 100.
              * Both values can be combined: 0/5000/1000,0/100/0.
         -->
         <dimension name="ELEVATION" type="intervals" default="0">0/5000/1000</dimension>

         <!-- Coming in a future version: support for ISO8601 date/time dimensions -->

      </dimensions>
   </tileset>

Services
================================================================================

Services are the type of request that mod-mapcache will respond to. You should,
of course, enable at least one.

.. code-block:: xml

   <service type="wms" enabled="true">
      <!-- 
           This service should actually be called "ogc". It is different from
           the other services as it does not listen on the /wms endpoint, but
           directly on /. It will intercept WMS GetMap requests that can be
           satisfied from configured tilesets, and can optionally forward all
           the rest to (an)other server(s).

           TODO: This needs way more documenting.

      <forwarding_rule name="foo rule">
        <append_pathinfo>true</append_pathinfo>
        <http>
          <url>http://localhost/mapcacheproxy</url>
        </http>
      </forwarding_rule>
      -->

      <!-- full_wms
 
           Configure response to WMS requests that are not aligned to a
           tileset's grids. Responding to requests that are not in the SRS of a
           configured grid is not supported, but this should never happen as
           only the supported SRSs are publicized in the capabilities document.

           Allowed values are:
             
           - error    : Return a 404 error (default).
           - assemble : Build the full image by assembling cached tiles.
           - forward  : Forward the request to the configured source.
      -->
      <full_wms>assemble</full_wms>

      <!-- resample mode

           Filter applied when resampling tiles for full WMS requests. Can be
           either:
      
           - nearest  : Fastest, poor quality.
           - bilinear : Slower, higher qulity.
      -->
      <resample_mode>bilinear</resample_mode>

      <!-- format

           Image format to use when assembling tiles.
      -->
      <format allow_client_override="true">myjpeg</format>

   </service>
   <service type="wmts" enabled="true"/>
   <service type="tms" enabled="true"/>

   <service type="demo" enabled="true"/>


Miscellaneous
================================================================================

.. code-block:: xml

   <!-- default_format

        Format to use when a client asks for an image that is dynamically
        created from multiple cached tiles. Note that using a PNG format with
        "best" compression is not recommended here as it is computationally
        expensive. It is better to use a PNG format with "fast"compression here,
        unless you have plenty of server CPU power and/or limited bandwidth.
   -->
   <default_format>JPEG</default_format>

   <!-- services

        Services that mod-mapcache will respond to. Each service is accessible
        at the URL http://host/path/to/mapcache/{service}, e.g.
        http://myhost/mapcache/wms for OGC WMS.
   -->

   <!-- errors

        Configure how errors will be reported back to a client:

        - log        : No error is reported back, except an HTTP error code.
        - report     : Return the error message to the client in textual format.
        - empty_img  : Return an empty image to the client. The actual error
                       code is in the X-Mapcache-Error HTTP header.
        - report_img : Return an image with the error text included inside. (Not
                       implemented yet.)

        The default setting is to report the error message back to the user. In
        production, you might want to set this to "log" if you're paranoid, or
        to "empty_img" if you want to play nice with non-conforming clients.
   -->
   <errors>report</errors>


.. code-block:: xml

   <locker type="disk">  <!-- this is the default -->
   <!--
        Where to put lockfiles (to block other clients while a metatile is being
        rendered). Defaults to /tmp. This location should be writable by the
        Apache user.
   -->
     <directory>/tmp</directory>
     <retry>0.01</retry> <!-- check back every .01 seconds -->
     <timeout>60</timeout> <!-- Consider a lock stale after this many seconds.
                                May cause issues if WMS rendering time exceeds
                                this value. -->
