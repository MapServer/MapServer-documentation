**mapcache_detail** - Coverage analysis of MapCache SQLite Caches

SYNOPSIS
=========

.. code-block:: text

    mapcache_detail [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
============

`mapcache_detail` main use case is users wanting to use offline a portion of
a MapCache cache covering a given geographical region. For that purpose, they
need to identify relevant files from an existing cache, check whether tiles are
missing from these files (possibly seeding missing parts if necessary), and
extract these files to build a new cache of the requested region.

`mapcache_detail`, helps users with some of these activities. It works with
SQLite caches where one single file may contains thousands of tiles. It
is able to:

  - Determine which SQLite files from the cache are needed to cover a given
    geographical region at a given zoom level range;

  - Count how many tiles are needed to cover the region and how many are
    already present in each file, giving a coverage ratio on file level, zoom
    level and global level;

  - Estimate data size of missing tiles, which need to be downloaded to
    entirely cover the requested region, again on file level, zoom level and
    global level.

`mapcache_detail` is able to handle all kinds of SQLite caches that MapCache
itself handles, namely:

  - :ref:`Single SQLite caches <mapcache_cache_sqlite>`, where only one SQLite
    database contains the whole cache;

  - :ref:`Multiple SQLite caches <mapcache_cache_multisqlite>`, where cache is
    split into multiple SQLite databases according to a given template;

  - :ref:`Composite SQLite caches <mapcache_cache_composite>`, which are a
    combination of single and multiple SQLite caches depending on zoom levels.

`mapcache_detail` takes the form of an independent CLI executable using
MapCache library. It is proposed as a simple contribution to the MapCache
project under a `contrib/mapcache_detail/` folder, due to its specific
purpose (only SQLite caches are handled).

OPTIONS
========

Some option have the same syntax and meaning as those of
:ref:`mapcache_seeder utility <mapcache_seed>`.

Miscellaneous options
----------------------

**-h, --help**
   Display help message and exit.

**-o, --short-output**
   (Optional) If this option is present, only Existing SQLite files are
   reported, missing SQLite files are still taken into account for level and
   global coverage.

Options for specifying the cache to analyze
--------------------------------------------

**-c, --config**  *MapCache configuration file*
   (Required) Set MapCache configuration file in which cache to analyze is
   specified.

**-t, --tileset** *tileset name*
   (Required) Set the tileset to analyze.

**-g, --grid** *grid name*
   (Required) Set the grid to analyze.

**-D, --dimension** *DIMENSION_NAME=VALUE*
   (Optional) Set the value of a dimension. This option can be used multiple
   times for multiple dimensions.

**-q, --query** <value>
   (Optional) Set SQL query for counting tiles in a rectangle. Default value,
   given below, works with default schema of SQLite caches.

   .. code-block:: SQL

      SELECT count(rowid)
        FROM tiles
       WHERE (x between :minx and :maxx)
         AND (y between :miny and :maxy)
         AND (z=:z)
         AND tileset=:tileset AND grid=:grid AND dim=:dim;


Options for specifying the region to cover
-------------------------------------------

**-z, --zoom** *minzoom[,maxzoom]*
   (Optional) Set min and max zoom levels to analyze, separated by a comma, eg:
   12,15. If *maxzoom* is absent, only zoom level specified by *minzoom* is
   analyzed. Default value is *0*.

Rectangular region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**-e, --extent** *minx,miny,maxx,maxy*
   (Optional) Set the extent to analyze. Default value is the whole grid
   extent. This option cannot be used with **--ogr-datasource** option.

Polygonal region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**-d, --ogr-datasource** *OGR data source*
   (Optional) Set the OGR data source to get features from. Any `OGR Vector
   Format`_ can be used. If absent, the region is specified using **--extent**
   option, possibly its default value. This option cannot be used with
   **–extent** option.

**-l, --ogr-layer** *layer*
   (Optional) Select the layer inside OGR data source. This option works only
   if **--ogr-datasource** has been specified. This option cannot be used with
   **–ogr-sql** option.

**-w, --ogr-where** *filter*
   (Optional) Set a filter to apply on OGR layer features. This option works
   only if **--ogr-datasource** has been specified. This option cannot be used
   with **–ogr-sql** option.

**-s, --ogr-sql** *SQL query*
   (Optional) SQL query to filter inside OGR data source. This option works
   only if **--ogr-datasource** has been specified. This option cannot be used
   with –ogr-layer or –ogr-where.

COUNTING TILES
===============

To illustrate the process, here is an example of a fictional grid. Tiles are
represented by the smallest squares on the grid. Larger squares of 25 tiles
each represent SQLite files. Small indices denote tile coordinates whereas
large indices denote databases coordinates. Colored rectangle represents
requested region for cache extraction. Darker tiles represent tiles present in
cache.

.. image:: ../images/mapcache-detail.png
   :scale: 50%
   :class: no-scaled-link

Expressed in tiles, region coordinates *(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)* are
(11, 7, 27, 20). Expressed in SQLite files, these coordinates are (2, 1, 5, 4).
All files whose coordinates are comprised between (2, 1) and (5, 4) included
shall be part of the cache extraction. All tiles whose coordinates are
comprised between (11, 7) and (27, 20) included shall be counted for the region
coverage.

Following table gives tile count and coverage ratio of requested region,
according to tool's process:

OUTPUT REPORT
==============

Tool's output, in JSON format,  provides user with SQLite file list to be
extracted from cache. Details are given on the number of tiles contributing to
region coverage. A synthesis is also given for each zoom level and at a global
level.

Following is a fictional example describing information present in tool's
output.

EXAMPLES
=========

Analyze tile coverage of tileset *osm* with the *g* grid. Default extent is the
whole world and default zoom level is 0:

.. code-block:: text

   mapcache_detail --config mapcache.xml --tileset osm --grid g

Same as beforehand, with explicit zoom levels 9 to 12 and explicit extent
covering Switzerland:

.. code-block:: text

   mapcache_detail --config mapcache.xml --tileset osm --grid g --zoom 9,12 --extent 663000,5751230,1167680,6075050
