MapServer Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MapServer is a popular Open Source project whose purpose is to display
dynamic spatial maps over the Internet. Some of its major features
include:

* support for display and querying of hundreds of raster, vector, and database
  formats
* ability to run on various operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, etc.)
* support for popular scripting languages and development environments
  (PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, .NET)
* on-the-fly projections
* high quality rendering
* fully customizable application output
* many ready-to-use Open Source application environments
	
In its most basic form, MapServer is a :term:`CGI` program that sits inactive
on your Web server. When a request is sent to MapServer, it uses information
passed in the request URL and the :ref:`Mapfile <mapfile>` to create an image
of the requested map. The request may also return images for legends, scale
bars, reference maps, and values passed as CGI variables. 

.. seealso::
    The :ref:`gloss` contains an overview of many of the jargon terms in this 
    document.

MapServer can be extended and customized through :ref:`MapScript <mapscript>`
or :ref:`templating <template>`. It can be built to support many different
:ref:`vector <vector>` and :ref:`raster <raster>` input data formats, and it
can generate a multitude of :ref:`output <output>` formats. Most pre-compiled
MapServer distributions contain most all of its features.

.. seealso::
    :ref:`unix` and :ref:`win32`

.. note::

    :term:`MapScript` provides a scripting interface for MapServer for
    the construction of Web and stand-alone applications. MapScript
    can be used independently of CGI MapServer, and it is a loadable
    module that adds MapServer capability to your favorite scripting
    language. MapScript currently exists in :ref:`PHP
    <php_mapscript>`, Perl, :ref:`Python <python>`, Ruby, Tcl, Java,
    and .NET flavors.

    This guide will not explicitly discuss MapScript, check out the
    :ref:`MapScript Reference <mapscript>` for more information.

Anatomy of a MapServer Application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: ./images/architecture.png
    :alt: MapServer Basic Architecture
    
    The basic architecture of MapServer applications. 

A simple MapServer application consists of:

* **Map File** - a structured text configuration file for your MapServer 
  application.  It defines the area of your map, tells the MapServer program 
  where your data is and where to output images.  It also defines your map 
  layers, including their data source, projections, and symbology.  
  It must have a .map extension or MapServer will not recognize it.
  
  .. seealso::
    :ref:`MapServer Mapfile Reference <mapfile>`
 
* **Geographic Data** - MapServer can utilize many geographic data source types. 
  The default format is the ESRI Shape format.  Many other data formats can be 
  supported, this is discussed further below in `Adding data to your site`_.
  
  .. seealso::
    :ref:`Vector Input Reference <vector>` and :ref:`Raster Input
    Reference <raster>`
 
* **HTML Pages** - the interface between the user and MapServer .  
  They normally sit in Web root.  In it's simplest form, MapServer can
  be called to place a static map image on a HTML page.  To make the
  map interactive, the image is placed in an HTML form on a page.
 
  :term:`CGI` programs are 'stateless', every request they get is new
  and they don't remember anything about the last time that they were
  hit by your application.  For this reason, every time your
  application sends a request to MapServer, it needs to pass context
  information (what layers are on, where you are on the map,
  application mode, etc.) in hidden form variables or URL variables.

  A simple MapServer :ref:`cgi` application may include two HTML pages:

  * **Initialization File** - uses a form with hidden variables to send an 
    initial query to the web server and MapServer.  This form could be placed 
    on another page or be replaced by passing the initialization information 
    as variables in a URL.

  * **Template File** - controls how the maps and legends output by
    MapServer will appear in the browser.  By referencing MapServer
    CGI variables in the template HTML, you allow MapServer to
    populate them with values related to the current state of your
    application (e.g. map image name, reference image name, map
    extent, etc.)  as it creates the HTML page for the browser to
    read.  The template also determines how the user can interact with
    the MapServer application (browse, zoom, pan, query).
    
    .. seealso::
        :ref:`template`

* **MapServer CGI** - The binary or executable file that receives requests and 
  returns images, data, etc.  It sits in the cgi-bin or scripts directory of 
  the web server.  The Web server user must have execute rights for the 
  directory that it sits in, and for security reasons, it should not be in 
  the web root.  By default, this program is called :ref:`mapserv`
 
* **Web/HTTP Server** - serves up the HTML pages when hit by the
  user's browser.  You need a working Web (HTTP) server, such as
  `Apache <http://httpd.apache.org>`__ or Microsoft Internet
  Information Server, on the machine on which you are installing
  MapServer.

Installation and Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows Installation
...............................................................................

OSGeo4W is a new Windows installer that downloads and/or updates MapServer,
add-on applications, and also other Open Source geospatial software. The
following steps illustrate how to use OSGeo4W:

1)  Download OSGeo4W
    http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup.exe

2)  Execute (double-click) the .exe

3)  Choose "Advanced" install type

    .. image:: ./images/osgeo4w-install-start.png

    .. note::
        Express contains options for higher-level packages such as MapServer,
        GRASS, and uDig. Advanced gives you full access to choosing
        commandline tools and applications for MapServer that are not
        included in the Express install

4)  Select packages to install

    .. image:: ./images/osgeo4w-install-next.png
    
    .. note::
        Click on the "Default" text beside the higher-level packages (such as
        Web) to install all of Web's sub-packages, or click on the "Skip" text
        beside the sub-package (such as MapServer) to install that package and
        all of its dependencies. 

5)  Let the installer fetch the packages.

    .. image:: ./images/osgeo4w-install-fetch.png

6)  Run the apache-install.bat script to install the Apache Service.
    
    .. note::
        You must run this script under the "OSGeo4W Shell".  This is usually 
        available as a shortcut on your desktop
    
    .. note::
        An apache-uninstall.bat script is also available to remove the 
        Apache service installation.
        
7)  Start Apache from the OSGeo4W shell and navigate to http://127.0.0.1

    ::
        
        apache-restart.bat

    .. image:: ./images/osgeo4w-install-complete.png

8)  Verify that MapServer is working

    .. image:: ./images/osgeo4w-install-verify.png
    
Hardware Requirements
...............................................................................

MapServer runs on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, and more.   
To compile or install some of the required programs, you may need 
administrative rights to the machine. People commonly ask questions about 
minimum hardware specifications for MapServer applications, but the answers 
are really specific to the individual application.  For development and 
learning purposes, a very minimal machine will work fine.   For deployment, 
you will want to investigate :ref:`optimization` of everything from your 
data to server configuration.

Software Requirements
...............................................................................

You need a working and properly configured Web (HTTP) server, such as `Apache
<http://httpd.apache.org/>`__ or Microsoft Internet Information Server, on the
machine on which you are installing MapServer. OSGeo4W contains Apache
already, but you can reconfigure things to use IIS if you need to.
Alternatively, `MS4W <http://www.maptools.org/ms4w/index.phtml>`__ can be 
used to install MapServer on Windows.

If you are on a Windows machine, and you don't have a web server installed,
you may want to check out `MS4W <http://www.maptools.org/ms4w/index.phtml>`__,
which will install a pre-configured web server, MapServer, and more. The `FGS
Linux Installer <http://www.maptools.org/fgs/>`__ provides similar
functionality for several Linux distributions.

This introduction will assume you are using pre-compiled OSGeo4W Windows
binaries to follow along. Obtaining MapServer or :ref:`Linux <linux>` or
:ref:`Mac OS X <osx>` should be straightforward. Visit :ref:`download` for
installing pre-compiled MapServer builds on Mac OS X and Linux.

You will also need a Web browser, and a text editor (vi, emacs, notepad,
homesite) to modify your HTML and :ref:`mapfiles <mapfile>`.

Skills
...............................................................................

In addition to learning how the different components of a MapServer
application work together and learning Map File syntax, building a basic
application requires some conceptual understanding and proficiency in several
skill areas.

You need to be able to create or at least modify `HTML
<http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/>`__ pages and understand how HTML forms work.
Since the primary purpose of a MapServer application is to create maps, you
will also need to understand the basics of geographic data and likely, map
projections. As your applications get more complex, skills in SQL,
DHTML/Javascript, Java, databases, expressions, compiling, and scripting may
be very useful.


Introduction to the :ref:`Mapfile <mapfile>`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The .map file is the basic configuration file for data access and styling for
MapServer. The file is an ASCII text file, and is made up of different
objects. Each object has a variety of parameters available for it. All .map
file (or mapfile) parameters are documented in the :ref:`mapfile reference 
<mapfile>`. A simple mapfile example displaying only one layer follows, as well 
as the map image output:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
        NAME "sample"
        STATUS ON
        SIZE 600 400
        SYMBOLSET "../etc/symbols.txt"
        EXTENT -180 -90 180 90 
        UNITS DD
        SHAPEPATH "../data"
        IMAGECOLOR 255 255 255
        FONTSET "../etc/fonts.txt"
        
        #
        # Start of web interface definition
        #
        WEB
            IMAGEPATH "/ms4w/tmp/ms_tmp/" 
            IMAGEURL "/ms_tmp/"
        END # WEB

        #
        # Start of layer definitions
        #
        LAYER
            NAME 'global-raster
            TYPE RASTER
            STATUS DEFAULT
            DATA bluemarble.gif
        END # LAYER
    END # MAP

.. figure:: ./images/bluemarble-rendered.jpg
    :alt: Rendered Bluemarble Image
    
    Rendered Bluemarble Image
    


.. note::

    * Comments in a mapfile are specified with a '#' character
    * MapServer parses mapfiles from top to bottom, therefore layers at the
      end of the mapfile will be drawn last (meaning they will be displayed on
      top of other layers)
    * Using relative paths is always recommended
    * Paths should be quoted (single or double quotes are accepted)
    * The above example is built on the following directory structure:

      * The mapfile could be placed anywhere, as long as it is
        accessible to the web server.  Normally, one would try to
        avoid placing it at a location that makes it accessible on the
        web.  Let us say it is placed in /home/msuser/mapfiles/

      * The location of the font file is given relative to the map
        file, in this case: /home/msuser/etc/fonts.txt

      * The location of the datasets (`bluemarble.gif`) is given
        relative to the map file, in this case: /home/msuser/data/

      * The location of the symbol file is given relative to the map
        file, in this case: /home/msuser/etc/symbols.txt
      
      * The files generated by Mapserver will be placed in the
        directory /ms4w/tmp/ms_tmp/.  The web server must be able to
        place files in this directory.  The web server must make this
        directory available as /ms_tmp (if the web server is on
        `www.ms.org`, the web address to the directory must be:
        `httpd://www.ms.org/ms_tmp/`.


:ref:`MAP` Object
...............................................................................

.. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
      NAME "sample"
      EXTENT -180 -90 180 90 # Geographic
      SIZE 800 400
      IMAGECOLOR 128 128 255
    END # MAP

* EXTENT is the output extent in the units of the output map
* SIZE is the width and height of the map image in pixels
* IMAGECOLOR is the default image background color

.. note::
  MapServer currently uses a pixel-center based extent model which is
  a bit different from what GDAL or WMS use.

:ref:`LAYER` Object
...............................................................................

* starting with MapServer 5.0, there is no limit to the number of layers in a
  mapfile
* the `DATA` parameter is relative to the `SHAPEPATH` parameter of the
  :ref:`MAP` object
* if no `DATA` extension is provided in the filename, MapServer will
  assume it is ESRI Shape format (.shp)

Raster Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME "bathymetry"
        TYPE RASTER
        STATUS DEFAULT
        DATA "bath_mapserver.tif"
    END # LAYER

.. seealso::
    
    :ref:`raster`

Vector Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vector layers of `TYPE` `point`, `line`, or `polygon` can be
displayed. The following example shows how to display only lines from
a `TYPE` polygon layer, using the `OUTLINECOLOR` parameter:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME "world_poly"
      DATA 'shapefile/countries_area.shp'
      STATUS ON
      TYPE POLYGON
      CLASS
        NAME 'The World'
        STYLE
          OUTLINECOLOR 0 0 0
        END # STYLE
      END # CLASS
    END # LAYER
   
.. seealso::
    :ref:`vector`

.. figure:: ./images/bluemarble-boundaries.jpg
    :alt: Rendered Bluemarble Image
    
    Rendered Bluemarble image with vector boundaries
    
    
:ref:`CLASS` and :ref:`STYLE` Objects
...............................................................................

* typical styling information is stored within the :ref:`CLASS` and
  :ref:`STYLE` objects of a :ref:`LAYER`
* starting with MapServer 5.0, there is no limit to the number of classes or
  styles in a mapfile
* the following example shows how to display a road line with two colors by
  using overlayed `STYLE` objects

.. code-block:: mapfile

    CLASS
      NAME "Primary Roads"
      STYLE
        SYMBOL "circle"
        COLOR 178 114 1
        SIZE 15
      END # STYLE
      STYLE
        SYMBOL "circle"
        COLOR 254 161 0
        SIZE 7
      END # STYLE
    END # CLASS

.. figure:: ./images/bluemarble-style.jpg
    :alt:   Rendered Bluemarble Image
    
    Rendered Bluemarble image with styled roads


:ref:`SYMBOLs <SYMBOL>`
...............................................................................

* can be defined directly in the mapfile, or in a separate file
* the separate file method must use the `SYMBOLSET` parameter in the
  `MAP` object:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
      NAME "sample"
      EXTENT -180 -90 180 90 # Geographic
      SIZE 800 400
      IMAGECOLOR 128 128 255
      SYMBOLSET "../etc/symbols.txt"
    END # MAP

where symbols.txt might contain:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    SYMBOL
      NAME "ski"
      TYPE PIXMAP
      IMAGE "ski.png"
    END # SYMBOL

and the mapfile would contain:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      ...
      CLASS
        NAME "Ski Area"
        STYLE
          SYMBOL "ski"
        END # STYLE
      END # CLASS
    END # LAYER

.. figure:: ./images/bluemarble-ski.jpg
    :alt: Rendered Bluemarble Image Skier
    
    Rendered Bluemarble image with skier symbol
    
.. seealso::
    :ref:`sym_construction`, :ref:`sym_examples`, and :ref:`symbol`


:ref:`LABEL`
...............................................................................

* defined within a :ref:`CLASS` object

* the `LABELITEM` parameters in the :ref:`LAYER` object can be used to
  specify an attribute in the data to be used for labeling.  The label
  is displayed by the `FONT`, declared in the :ref:`FONTSET` file (set
  in the :ref:`MAP` object).  The :ref:`FONTSET` file contains
  references to the available font names.  `ENCODING` describes which
  encoding is used in the file (see :ref:`LABELENCODING`).

An example :ref:`LABEL` object that references one of the above fonts might
look like:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LABEL
      FONT "sans-bold"
      TYPE truetype
      ENCODING "UTF-8"
      SIZE 10
      POSITION LC
      PARTIALS FALSE
      COLOR  100 100 100
      OUTLINECOLOR 242 236 230
    END # LABEL

.. figure:: ./images/bluemarble-ski-label.jpg
    :alt: Rendered Bluemarble Image Skier
    
    Rendered Bluemarble image with skier symbol and a label

.. seealso::
    :ref:`label`, :ref:`fontset`

:ref:`CLASS` :ref:`Expressions <expressions>`
...............................................................................

MapServer supports three types of :ref:`CLASS` :ref:`expressions` in a
:ref:`LAYER` (`CLASSITEM` in `LAYER` determines the attribute to be
used for the two first types of expressions):

1) String comparisons

    ::
    
        EXPRESSION "africa"

2) Regular expressions 

    ::
    
        EXPRESSION /^9|^10/

3) Logical expressions 

    ::
    
        EXPRESSION ([POPULATION] > 50000 AND '[LANGUAGE]' eq 'FRENCH')

.. note::
    Logical expressions should be avoided wherever possible as they are very
    costly in terms of drawing time.

.. seealso::
    :ref:`expressions`

:ref:`INCLUDE` 
...............................................................................

Added to MapServer 4.10, any part of the mapfile can now be stored in a
separate file and added to the main mapfile using the :ref:`INCLUDE`
parameter. The filename to be included can have any extension, and it is
always relative to the main .map file.
Here are some potential uses:

* :ref:`LAYER`\s can be stored in files and included to any number of
  applications
* :ref:`STYLE`\s can also be stored and included in multiple applications

The following is an example of using mapfile :ref:`includes
<include>` to include a layer definition in a separate file:

If 'shadedrelief.lay' contains:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME 'shadedrelief'
      STATUS ON
      TYPE RASTER
      DATA 'GLOBALeb3colshade.jpg'
    END # LAYER

therefore the main mapfile would contain:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
      ...
      INCLUDE "shadedrelief.lay"
      ...
    END # MAP

The following is an example of a mapfile where all :ref:`LAYER` s are in
separate .lay files, and all other objects (:ref:`WEB`, :ref:`REFERENCE`,
:ref:`SCALEBAR`, etc.) are stored in a ".ref" file:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    MAP
      NAME "base"
      #
      # include reference objects
      #
      INCLUDE "../templates/template.ref"
      #
      # Start of layer definitions
      #
      INCLUDE "../layers/usa/usa_outline.lay"
      INCLUDE "../layers/canada/base/1m/provinces.lay"
      INCLUDE "../layers/canada/base/1m/roads_atlas_of_canada_1m.lay"
      INCLUDE "../layers/canada/base/1m/roads_atlas_of_canada_1m_shields.lay"
      INCLUDE "../layers/canada/base/1m/populated_places.lay"
    END # MAP

.. warning::
    :ref:`Mapfiles <mapfile>` must have the ``.map`` extension or 
    MapServer will not recognize them.  Include files can have any extension
    you want, however.

.. seealso::
    :ref:`include`
    
Get MapServer Running
...............................................................................

You can test if MapServer is working by running the Mapserver
executable (``mapserv``) with the -v parameter on the command line
(./mapserv -v).  Depending on your configuration, the output could be
something like this:

::

   MapServer version 6.0.1 OUTPUT=GIF OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG
   SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=AGG SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=ICONV
   SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER INPUT=SHAPEFILE


You can also send a HTTP request directly to the MapServer CGI program without
passing any configuration variables (e.g.
http://your.domain.name/cgi-bin/ms4/mapserv.exe). If you receive the message,
'No query information to decode. `QUERY_STRING` not set.', your installation is
working.

Get Demo Running
...............................................................................

Download the `MapServer Demo
<http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us/mapserver_demos/workshop-5.4.zip>`__.
UnZip it and follow the directions in ReadMe.txt.  You will need to
move the demo files to their appropriate locations on your web
server, and modify the Map File and HTML pages to reflect the paths
and URLs of your server.  Next, point your browser to init.html and
hit the 'initialize button'.  If you get errors, verify that you have
correctly modified the demo files.

Making the Site Your Own
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have a working MapServer demo, you can use the demo to display 
your own data.  Add new `LAYER`\s to your Map file that refer to your own 
geographic data layers (you will probably want to delete the existing layers 
or set their status to `OFF`).

Unless you are adding layers that fall within the same geographic area
as the demo, modify :ref:`MAP` `EXTENT` to match the extent of your
data.  To determine the extent of your data, you can use `ogrinfo
<http://www.gdal.org/ogrinfo.html>`__.  If you have access to a GIS,
you could use that as well.  The :ref:`MAP` `EXTENT` needs to be in the
units of your output projection.
	
If you add geographic data layers with different geographical
reference systems, you will need to modify your Map File to add a
:ref:`PROJECTION` block to the :ref:`map` (defines the output
projection / geographical reference system) and each of the
:ref:`layer`\s (defines the geographical reference system of the layer
dataset).

Adding Data to Your Site
...............................................................................

MapServer supports several data input formats 'natively', and many more if 
it is compiled with the open source libraries :term:`GDAL` and :term:`OGR`.

Vector Data
...............................................................................

Vector data includes features made up of points, lines, and polygons.  
MapServer support the ESRI Shape format by default, but it can be compiled to 
support spatially enabled databases such as 
`PostgreSQL-PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`__,
and file formats such as
`Geography Markup Language (GML) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language>`__, 
`MapInfo <http://www.mapinfo.com/>`__, delimited text files, and more
formats with :ref:`ogr`.

See the :ref:`Vector Data reference <vector>` for examples on how to
add different geographic data sources to your MapServer project.

Raster Data
...............................................................................

Raster data is image or grid data. By default, MapServer supports
Tiff/GeoTiff, and EPPL7. With `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`__, it supports
GRASS, Jpeg2000, ArcInfo Grids, and `more formats
<http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html>`__. If you do compile MapServer with
GDAL, which includes tiff support, do not compile with native tiff support, as
this will cause a conflict. More specific information can be found in the
:ref:`Raster Data reference <raster>`.

Projections
...............................................................................

Because the earth is round and your monitor (or paper map) is flat, distortions 
will occur when you display geographic data in a two-dimensional image.  
Projections allow you to represent geographic data on a flat surface.   In 
doing so, some of the original properties (e.g. area, direction, distance, 
scale or conformity) of the data will be distorted.  Different projections 
excel at accurately portraying different properties.  A good 
`primer <http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html>`__ 
on map projections  can be found at the University of Colorado.

With MapServer, if you keep all of your spatial data sets in the same
projection (or unprojected Latitude and Longitude), you do not need to
include any projection info in your Map File.  In building your first
MapServer application, this simplification is recommended.

On-the-fly projection can be accomplished when MapServer is compiled with
:term:`Proj.4` support. Instructions on how to enable Proj.4 support on
Windows can be found on the `Wiki
<https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/wiki/WindowsProjHowto>`__.

Enhancing your site
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding Query Capability
...............................................................................

There are two primary ways to query spatial data. Both methods return data
through the use of templates and CGI variable replacement. A :ref:`QUERYMAP`
can be used to map the results of the query.

To be queryable, each mapfile :ref:`LAYER` must have a :ref:`TEMPLATE
<template>` defined, or each :ref:`CLASS` within the LAYER must have a
TEMPLATE defined. More information about the CGI variables used to define
queries can be found in the :ref:`MapServer CGI Reference <cgi>`.

Attribute queries
...............................................................................

The user selects features based on data associated with that feature.  
'Show me all of the lakes where depth is greater than 100 feet', with 
'depth' being a field in the Shape dataset or the spatial database.  
Attribute queries are accomplished by passing query definition information 
to MapServer in the URL (or form post).  Mode=itemquery returns a single 
result, and mode=itemnquery returns multiple result sets.  

The request must also include a QLAYER, which identifies the layer to be
queried, and a QSTRING which contains the query string. Optionally, QITEM, can
be used in conjunction with QSTRING to define the field to be queried.
Attribute queries only apply within the `EXTENT` set in the map file.

Spatial queries
...............................................................................

The user selects features based on a click on the map or a user-defined 
selection box.  Again the request is passed through a URL or form post.  
By setting mode=QUERY, a user click will return the one closest feature. 
In mode=NQUERY, all features found by a map click or user-defined selection 
box are returned.  Additional query options can be found in the :ref:`cgi`
documentation.

Data Optimization
...............................................................................

Data organization is at least as important as hardware configuration in 
optimizing a MapServer application for performance.  MapServer is quite 
efficient at what it does, but by reducing the amount of processing that 
it needs to do at the time of a user request, you can greatly increase 
performance.  Here are a few rules:

* **Index Your data** - By creating spatial indexes for your Shape
  datasets using :ref:`shptree`. Spatial indexes should also be
  created for spatially aware databases such as PostGIS and Oracle
  Spatial.

* **Tile Your Data** - Ideally, your data will be 'sliced up' into
  pieces about the size in which it will be displayed.  There is
  unnecessary overhead when searching through a large Shape dataset or
  image of which you are only going to display a small area.  By
  breaking the data up into tiles and creating a tile index, MapServer
  only needs to open up and search the data files of interest.  Shape
  datasets can be broken into smaller tiles and then a tileindex Shape
  dataset can be created using the :ref:`tile4ms <tile4ms>` utility.
  A :ref:`tileindex <tileindex>` Shape dataset for raster files can
  also be created.
          
* **Pre-Classify Your Data** - MapServer allows for the use of quite
  complex :ref:`EXPRESSIONs <expressions>` to classify data. However,
  using logical and regular expressions is more resource intensive
  than string comparisons.  To increase efficiency, you can divide
  your data into classes ahead of time, create a field to use as the
  `CLASSITEM` and populate it with a simple value that identifies the
  class, such as 1,2,3, or 4 for a four class data set.  You can then
  do a simple string comparison for the class `EXPRESSION`.

* **Pre-Process Your Images** - Do resource intensive processing up front.  
  See the :ref:`Raster Data reference <raster>` for more info.

* **Generalize for Overview** - create a more simple, generalized data layer 
  to display at small scales, and then use scale-dependent layers utilizing 
  :ref:`LAYER` `MINSCALE` and 
  `LAYER` `MAXSCALE` to show more detailed data layers as the user zooms in.  
  This same concept applies to images.

Users Mailing List
...............................................................................

Register and post questions to the 
`MapServer Users <http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/mapserver-users/>`__ 
mailing list.
Questions to the list are usually answered quickly and often by the 
developers themselves.  A few things to remember:  

1. `Search the archives <http://n2.nabble.com/MapServer-f1969210.html>`__ for 
   your answer first, people get tired of answering
   the same questions over and over.
2. Provide version and configuration information for your MapServer
   installation, and relevant snippets of your map and template files.
3. Always post your responses back to the whole list, as opposed to just the
   person who replied to your question.

IRC
...............................................................................

MapServer users and developers can be found on Internet Relay Chat.  The
channel is #mapserver on irc.freenode.net.

...............................................................................

`Web Mapping Illustrated
<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/webmapping/>`__\, a book by Tyler
Mitchell that describes well and provides real-world examples for the
use of Web mapping concepts, Open Source GIS software, MapServer, Web
services, and PostGIS.

`Mapping Hacks <http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mappinghks/>`__\, by
Schuyler Erle, Rich Gibson, and Jo Walsh, creatively demonstrates
digital mapping tools and concepts.  MapServer only appears in a
handful of the 100 hacks, but many more are useful for concepts and
inspiration.

`Beginning MapServer: Opensource GIS Development
<http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=443>`__\, by Bill
Kropla.  According to the publisher, it covers installation and
configuration, basic MapServer topics and features, incorporation of
dynamic data, advanced topics, MapScript, and the creation of an
actual application.
