Introduction
------------

This document describes the changes that must be made to PHP MapScript
applications when migrating from one MapServer version to another (i.e. backwards
incompatibilities), as well as information on some of the new features.

Migrating to 7.4's new SWIG API and PHP 7
-----------------------------------------

As of the MapServer 7.4.0 release, users are recommended to switch to 
MapServer's new :ref:`SWIG <swig>` API support of PHP 7+ (reason for 
recommendation: as we saw with the breaking PHP 7 changes,
managing PHP through SWIG will be easier on the MapServer maintainers in 
the long run).  Some important SWIG notes:
  
- you will require at least `SWIG-3.0.11 <http://www.swig.org/download.html>`_  
  (but 4.0.0 is recommended).
  
- if you notice any missing functions that were available in the old native PHP MapScript API,
  first please check the :ref:`SWIG API <swig>` reference document for an alternative function to use,
  and if there is nothing similar available then `file a ticket <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues>`_ 
  for each function that you require.
  
- all of your PHP scripts (that leverage MapServer objects and functions) must now always 
  first include the generated `mapscript.php` file containing MapServer constants:

  ::
  
   // required SWIG include (contains MapServer constants for PHP7)
   include("C:/ms4w/apps/phpmapscriptng-swig/include/mapscript.php");    
  
- take note of the change in how to declare your new objects:

  ::
  
    // open map
    $oMap = new mapObj("C:/ms4w/apps/phpmapscriptng-swig/sample.map");
    
  instead of the former way:
  
  ::
  
    // open map
    $oMap = ms_newMapObj("C:/ms4w/apps/phpmapscript/sample.map");

Migrating 5.6 to 6.0
--------------------

PHP Version Required
====================

PHP 5.2.0 or more recent is required. The support for earlier versions
has been dropped.
  
Error Reporting
===============

PHP MapScript now uses exceptions for error reports. All errors are
catchable. There are no more fatal errors reported via the standard
uncatchable PHP system (Only Warnings).
  
Manipulating Objects
====================

* Object properties can be set like all other PHP objects.

.. code-block:: php 

    $map->scaledenom = 25000;
  
.. note::
    The set/setProperty methods are still available. 

* Objects can be created with the PHP "new" operator.

.. code-block:: php

  $myShape = ms_newShapeObj(MS_SHAPE_LINE); // or
  $myShape = new shapeObj(MS_SHAPE_LINE);

.. note::
   All object constructors throw an exception on failure.
  
.. note::
     
    *ms_newSymbolObj()* and *new symbolObj()* are different

    * ms_newSymbolObj() returns the id of the new/existing symbol.
    * new symbolObj() returns the symbolObj. You don't need to get it with getSymbolObjectById().

* Cloneable objects should be cloned with the PHP clone keyword. There is no more clone methods.

Class Properties
================

Class properties that have been removed:

  * classObj: maxscale, minscale
  * layerObj: labelsizeitem, labelangleitem, labelmaxscale, labelminscale, maxscale, minscale, symbolscale, transparency
  * legendObj: interlace, transparent
  * mapObj: imagetype, imagequality, interlace, scale, transparent  
  * scalebarObj: interlace, transparent
  * symbolObj: gap, stylelength
  * webObj: minscale, maxscale
  
Class Methods
=============
  
Class methods that have been removed:

  * imageObj: free
  * layerObj: getFilter, getShape  
  * lineObj: free
  * pointObj: free
  * projectionObj: free  
  * rectObj: free
  * shapeObj: union_geos
  * symbolObj: getstylearray
  * classObj: clone
  * styleObj: clone
  * mapObj: clone
  * outputFormatObj: getformatoption, setformatoption

layerObj
========

layerObj->clearProcessing() method now returns void.

mapObj
======

mapObj->queryByIndex(): default behavior for the addToQuery parameter was not ok, now it is.

referenceMapObj
===============

referenceMapObj has new properties: marker, markername, markersize, maxboxsize, minboxsize.

shapeFileObj
============

shapeFileObj is automatically closed/writed on destroy. (At the end of the script or with an explicit free(), unset())

labelCacheObj
=============

To free the cache, you'll have to call the method freeCache() rather than
free().

Methods that now return MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE
=============================================
  
  * layerObj: setProcessing, addFeature, draw  
  * mapObj: moveLayerUp, moveLayerDown, zoomRectangle, zoomScale, setProjection, setWKTProjection, setLayersDrawingOrder
  * outputFormatObj: validate
  * scalebarObj: setImageColor
  * symbolObj: setPoints, setPattern  

Methods that now return NULL on failure
=======================================

  * classObj: clone
  * mapObj: clone, draw, drawQuery getLayerByName, getProjection  
  * layerObj: nextShape, getExtent
  * styleObj: clone  

Methods that now return an empty array 
======================================
  
  * layerObj: getItems, getProcessing, getGridIntersectionCoordinates
  * mapObj: getLayersIndexByGroup, getAllGroupNames, getLayersDrawingOrder, getAllLayerNames
  * symbolObj: getPatternArray
