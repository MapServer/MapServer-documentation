Introduction
*************

This is a `PHP <http://www.php.net/>`_ module that makes MapServer's
MapScript functionalities available in a PHP Dynamically Loadable
Library. In simple terms, this module will allow you to use the
powerful PHP scripting language to dynamically create and modify map
images in MapServer.

Versions Supported
------------------

PHP 5.2.0 or more recent is required; As of MapServer 7.4.0, PHP 7
is available through the :ref:`SWIG API <swig>`, and all existing MapServer 
users are encouraged to update their scripts for the new SWIG syntax;
see the :ref:`migration` for example syntax.

Support for PHP 4, PHP 5.0 and PHP 5.1 was dropped as of MapServer 6.0.
PHP MapScript was originally developed for PHP 3.0.14, and after 
MapServer 3.5 support for PHP 3 was dropped.

The module has been tested and used on Linux, Solaris, \*BSD, and Windows.

 .. note::
   If you are using MapServer 5.6 and older, please refer 
   to the :ref:`PHP MapScript 5.6 documentation <php5.6>` instead.
 
 .. note:: If you are migrating your existing application that is
   based on MapServer 5.6 or older, to MapServer 7.4 or beyond,
   please read the :ref:`PHP MapScript Migration Guide
   <php_migration_guide>` for important changes.
   
Windows Binaries
----------------

PHP 7+ mapscript is included in `MS4W <https://ms4w.com/>`__, the popular
installer maintained by Gateway Geomatics.  You can also
see user-contributed PHP 7 scripts through the SWIG API, on the
`MS4W wiki <https://ms4w.com/trac/>`__.

How to Get More Information on PHP MapScript
--------------------------------------------

- For installation questions regarding the PHP MapScript module, see  
  :ref:`php_install`.
- The `MapServer Wiki`_ has information on this module, that was
  contributed by users.
- New PHP MapScript users should read the :ref:`php_example` document.
- The project's home is the `PHP/MapScript page`_ on MapTools.org.  
- Also, see the :ref:`mapscript`, and the :ref:`mapfile` sections of
  this site.
- Refer to the main `PHP site`_ for their official documentation.

Memory Management
------------------

Normally, you should not have to worry about the memory management
because php has a garbage collector and will free resources for
you. If you write only small scripts that don't do a lot of
processing, it's not worth to care about that. Everything will be
freed at the end of the script.

However, it may be useful to free resources during the execution if
the script executes many tasks. To do so, you'll have to call the
**free()** method of the mapscript objects and unset the php
variables. The purpose of the free methods is to break the circular
references between an object and its properties to allow the zend
engine to free the resources.

Here's an example of a script (using the legacy syntax, not the 
:ref:`SWIG API <swig>` syntax) that doesn't free things 
during the execution:

.. code-block:: php

    $map = new mapObj("mapfile.map");
    $of = $map->outputformat;
    echo $map->extent->minx." - ".$map->extent->miny." - ".
                     $map->extent->maxx." - ".$map->extent->maxy."\n";
    echo "Outputformat name: $of->name\n";
    unset($of);
    unset($map); // Even if we unset the php variables, resources
                 // won't be freed.  Resources will be only freed
                 // at the end of the script

and the same script that frees resources as soon as it can

.. code-block:: php

    $map = new mapObj("mapfile.map");
    $of = $map->outputformat;
    echo $map->extent->minx." - ".$map->extent->miny." - ".
                     $map->extent->maxx." - ".$map->extent->maxy."\n";
    echo "Outputformat name: $of->name\n";
    unset($of);
    $map->free(); // break the circular references
    // at this place, the outputformat ($of) and the rect object
    // ($map->extent) resources are freed
    unset($map);
    // the map object is immediately freed after the unset (before the
    // end of the script)
