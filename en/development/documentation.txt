Background
----------

The current structure of the MapServer documentation process is for
developers with :ref:`SVN` commit access to maintain their documents
in reStructuredText format, and therefore all documents live in the
/docs directory in SVN.  The `Sphinx`_ documentation generator is
used to convert the reStructuredText files to html, and the live
website is then updated on an hourly basis.

General Guidelines
------------------

* MapServer instead of mapserver, map server, Map Server, mapServer or
  map Server.
* MapScript instead of mapscript, Mapscript, or map script.
* PostGIS instead of postgis.
* HowTo instead of howto or HOWTO.
* Email addresses should be manually spam protected:

  ::

      hobu.inc at gmail.com instead of hobu.inc@gmail.com

reStructuredText Reference Guides
---------------------------------

* `Quick reStructuredText`_

reStructuredText Formatting
---------------------------

* All text should be hard breaks at or around the 80 column mark, just as
  the source code.
* No ``.. sectnum::`` in the contents directives
* All external links should live at the bottom of your document, under
  the heading:

  ::

      .. #### rST Link Section ####
* Always include the :Revision: and :Date: lines (as-is) at the top of your
  document, such as:

  ::

      :Revision: $Revision$
      :Date: $Date$

Installing and Using Sphinx for rst-html Generation
---------------------------------------------------

.. note::
   
    As of 2010-06-01 the MapServer site requires Sphinx 1.0.  You can browse
    the versions of the Sphinx packages `here <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=index>`__,
    and then install the exact version such as:
        
    ::
        
        easy_install Sphinx==1.0.7


**On Windows:**

#. install `Python 2.X`_
#. download `setuptools`_
#. make sure that the 'C:/Python2X/Scripts' directory is your path
#. execute the following at commandline:

   ::

       easy_install Sphinx

   ...you should see message: "Finished processing dependencies for Sphinx"

   .. note::
   
      Make sure you install Sphinx 1.0 or more recent.  See note above.
      
#. inside the /docs directory, execute:

   ::

       make html

   or

   ::

       make latex

   the HTML output will be written to the _build/html sub-directory.

**On Linux:**

#. make sure you have the Python dev and setuptools packages installed.
   On Ubuntu:

   ::

       sudo apt-get install python-dev
       sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

#. install sphinx using easy_install:

   ::

       sudo easy_install Sphinx
       
   .. note::
    
      Make sure you install Sphinx 1.0 or more recent.  See note above.       

#. to process the docs, from the MapServer /docs directory, run:

   ::

       make html

   or

   ::

       make latex

   the HTML output will be written to the build/html sub-directory.

.. note::

    If there are more than one translation, the above commands will automatically
    build all translations.


**On OS X:**

#. install sphinx using easy_install:

   ::

       sudo easy_install Sphinx
       
   .. note::
   
      Make sure you install Sphinx 1.0 or more recent.  See note above.        

# install MacTex from http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/ if you want to build pdfs

#. to process the docs, from the MapServer /docs directory, run:

   ::

       make html

   or

   ::

       make latex

   the HTML output will be written to the build/html sub-directory.

.. note::

    If there are more than one translation, the above commands will automatically
    build all translations.

How translations are handled
----------------------------


* All translations are organized in subdirectories in MapServer /docs directory
* The directories are named using `ISO3166-1 alpha-2 country codes`_, which
  will also reference to the corresponding flag icon
* Translations are based on the English docs
* The directory structure and filenames must be kept, they are used to
  generate links between the different translations

.. note::

    To start a new translation, copy the directories images and include
    from docs/en to docs/<lang>, where <lang> is one of the country codes.  You also 
    should copy the docs/en/documentation.txt and docs/en/index.txt files into
    your <lang> directory (the build process requires these files...you
    are free to edit them as you wish for your own language).

* Only translated files are kept in the <lang> directories and the repository.
* The build script (Makefile and make.bat) have an option (init) to preprocess
  the <lang> directories. That means that each not translated English file is
  copied to the target <lang> directory. You don't have to do this to build
  html files locally. If you do this, you have to clean up you directories
  afterwards.
* To keep the translations in sync with the English docs, the translators
  can monitor commits to the repository.

.. note::

    One way to monitor changes is to subscribe the rss feed at
    http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/log/trunk/docs

* You have to define which languages are available by setting TRANSLATIONS in the
  Makefile or make.bat:

   ::

      TRANSLATIONS     = en de

The build script will then process the subdirectories *en* and *de*. If they
are not accessible, an error message will be returned.



Reference Labels
----------------

.. include:: ../include/labels.inc


Regenerating the reference labels
..................................

You can regenerate the reference labels by issuing:

::

    make labels

from the docs directory like when you are building the html or latex versions
