Background
----------

The current structure of the MapServer documentation process is for
developers to maintain their documents in reStructuredText format, and 
submit their changes through :ref:`git` pull requests; 
you will first need to create a `free personal account <https://github.com/pricing/>`__ at GitHub.
The `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ documentation generator is
used to convert the reStructuredText files to html, and the live
website is then automatically updated on each merged pull request.

.. note::
   
    The live website is actually built automatically on Travis CI, triggered by 
    each commit to GitHub.  See the build history at https://travis-ci.com/github/MapServer/MapServer-documentation

GitHub Notes
------------

* Documentation files are stored in the /MapServer-documentation sub-project on GitHub at: https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer-documentation
* Always submit pull requests to *main*, and if applicable your changes will be 
  backported to a specific branch
* All files should have only *LF* as line feed.  Line feed (or 'linefeed') differences can 
  cause problems when comparing files through Git (Windows uses both a carriage-return 
  character and a line feed character for newlines in its files, whereas macOS and 
  Linux systems use only the line feed character).  One option is to have Git convert 
  CRLF to LF on commit, by setting this at the commandline:
  
  ::
  
    git config --global core.autocrlf input
    
* See GitHub's `help guidelines <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git/>`__ 
  to install Git locally
* Useful git commands:

  * clone 'main' locally:
   
    ::
   
      git clone https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer-documentation.git MapServer-documentation-git-main
      
  * update local files:
  
    ::
    
      git pull
      
  * add file to repository (need to commit after this):
  
    ::
    
      git add <file>
      
  * commit file to repository:
  
    ::
    
      git commit -m "my message" <files>  

Workflow for simple edits
-------------------------

For simple edits (typos, etc.) not necessarily requiring compilation of the documentation,
a simpler workflow to create a Pull Request, can be adopted that does not require any local tool:

* Create a GitHub account if not already done
* Go to https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer-documentation
* Click on the "Fork" button
* You are now on https://github.com/{your_account}/MapServer-documentation
* Click on the "Branch: ..." list (to the left of the green "New pull request" button)
* In the text box, entry a name describing your changes to create a new branch (ex "typo_fix")
* You are now on https://github.com/{your_account}/tree/{branch_name}
* Browse through the tree and click on the file you want to edit. To find the file
  you want to edit, you may type text in the Search entry box
  at the top of the page (for example "Workflow for simple edits" to find this page)
* Click on the "Edit this file" button (with a pen icon)
* When done, fill the "Commit changes" section at the bottom of the page
  (a title is enough for most changes)
* Click on the "Commit changes" button at the bottom of the page
* Repeat the process with other files if needed.
* When done, go back to https://github.com/{your_account}/tree/{branch_name}
  and click on the "New pull request" button
* You can see your changes and edit the pull request summary message if needed
* Click on the "Create pull request" button to confirm
* You're done ! (Someone with push rights will have to review and merge your changes)

Branch cleanup :

* Once merged, you can delete branches when going to the Branch page : https://github.com/{your_account}/MapServer-documentation/branches
* Click on the trash bin icon at the right of the branch you want to delete.

General Writing Guidelines
--------------------------

* MapServer instead of mapserver, map server, Map Server, mapServer or
  map Server.
* MapScript instead of mapscript, Mapscript, or map script.
* PostGIS instead of postgis.
* GitHub instead of Github or github
* HowTo instead of howto or HOWTO.
* Email addresses should be manually spam protected:

  ::

      myname at gmail.com instead of myname@gmail.com

reStructuredText Reference Guides
---------------------------------

* `Quick reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`__

reStructuredText Formatting
---------------------------

* All text should be hard breaks at or around the 80 column mark, just as
  the source code.
* No `.. sectnum::` in the contents directives
* Always include the :Last Updated: line at the top of your
  document, such as:

  ::

      :Last Updated: 2021-02-16
      
* Directives `versionadded`, `deprecated`, `versionremoved` should be placed 
  directly below the parameter name, such as:
  
  ::
  
    PARAMETER
      .. deprecated:: 8.0
         Use a :ref:`xxx` block instead.

Installing and Using Sphinx for rst-html Generation
---------------------------------------------------

.. note::
   
    As of 2021-03-19 the MapServer site requires at least Sphinx 3.5.0, 
    alabaster 0.7.12, and the `sphinx-removed-in` extension - You can check 
    the exact versions that the live website uses in the file 
    `requirements.txt <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer-documentation/blob/main/requirements.txt/>`__, 
    (or you can instead browse the latest versions of the Sphinx packages `here <https://pypi.org/>`__)
    and then install locally such as:
    ::
        
        pip install -r requirements.txt


**On Windows:**

1. install `Python 3.X <https://www.python.org/>`__
2. make sure that the 'C:/Python3X/Scripts' directory is your path
3. install *pip*

  a) execute the following at the commandline:

    ::
     
       pip help
       
  b) if the command is not found, then download the file `get-pip.py <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py>`__
     locally.
     
  c) execute the following at the commandline:
  
    ::
     
       python get-pip.py 
      
    
4. inside the /MapServer-documentation directory, execute:

   ::

       python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

   ...you should see message: "Finished processing dependencies for Sphinx"
      
5. inside the /MapServer-documentation directory, execute:

   ::

       make html

   or

   ::

       make latex

   the HTML output will be written to the _build/html sub-directory.
#. install MiKTeX from https://miktex.org/download if you want to build pdfs   

**On Linux:**

#. Most flavors come with python installed (check with *python --version*), for
   specific steps check with your distribution.  An example command might be:

   ::

       sudo apt-get install python3.9

#. install pip

   ::

       curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
       python get-pip.py 

#. install Sphinx.  Inside the /MapServer-documentation directory, 
   execute:

   ::

       python -m pip install -r requirements.txt       

#. to process the documentation, from the /MapServer-documentation directory, run:

   ::

       make html
       make html BUILD_LANGUAGES=

   or

   ::

       make latex

   the HTML output will be written to the build/html sub-directory.

.. note::

    If there are more than one translation, the above commands will automatically
    build all translations, unless you add a "BUILD_LANGUAGES=" to the make arguments


**On OS X:**

#. install sphinx using pip.  Inside the /MapServer-documentation directory, 
   execute:

   ::

       python -m pip install -r requirements.txt      

#. install MacTex from http://www.tug.org/mactex/ if you want to build pdfs

#. to process the documentation, from the MapServer /MapServer-documentation directory, run:

   ::

       make compile_messages

       make html

   or

   ::

       make compile_messages

       make latex

   the HTML output will be written to the build/html sub-directory.

.. note::

    If there are more than one translation, the above commands will automatically
    build all translations.

(English) typo fixing script
----------------------------

(Tested on Linux. Should also likely run on MacOSX. Windows users might need
to install Cygwin, Python 3, git, curl, sed, grep, awk)

The script in scripts/fix_typos.sh is an interactive script to detect and correct
common spelling issues in the English documentation (en/ directory).

It requires Python 3 (python3 executable) to run. The first time it is run,
it also uses 'git' and 'curl' binaries to download the codespell engine,
its own dictionary, as well as the Debian Lintian and QGIS dictionaries.
They are downloaded in the fix_typos/ subdirectories. This directory can be
safely removed at any time (to enable getting new versions of the dictionaries
or the codespell engine).

The script is launched with :

::

    ./scripts/fix_typos.sh

Whenever a typo is detected, it asks if it must be fixed with the proposed
replacement (Y/N), or in case if there are several options, to select the option
(0, 1, etc..).

It contains a white list of words that are marked as not being typo errors (in
the WORDS_WHITE_LIST variable). The EXCLUDED_FILES variable can also be edited
to add files fully ignored. The scripts/typos_whitelist.txt file can be edited
to add full lines that should be ignored (sensitive to starting and trailing
whitespace/tabulations, and only work on LF terminated files, hence prior conversion
from CRLF to LF might be needed). scripts/typos_whitelist.txt should be used rather
than WORDS_WHITE_LIST, only when a word is not a typo in a given context, but
might be a typo in another context.


How translations are handled
----------------------------

Nowadays, MapServer have two coexisting systems to manage translations process.
Both rely on Sphinx software.

The first one was the answer to the absence of internationalization support in 
first days of the Sphinx software. The second use the new system of  
`internationalization <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/advanced/intl.html>`__ and is currently only used for the French translation.

The "old" way for translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although we think that nowadays the new system is better, we do not wanted to enforce 
every language community to change their habits.


* All translations are organized in subdirectories in MapServer's /MapServer-documentation directory
* The directories are named using `ISO3166-1 alpha-2 country codes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>`__, which
  will also reference to the corresponding flag icon
* Translations are based on the English documentation
* The directory structure and filenames must be kept, they are used to
  generate links between the different translations

.. note::

    To start a new translation, copy the directories images and include
    from MapServer-documentation/en to MapServer-documentation/<lang>, where <lang> is one of the country codes.  You also 
    should copy the MapServer-documentation/en/documentation.txt and MapServer-documentation/en/index.txt files into
    your <lang> directory (the build process requires these files...you
    are free to edit them as you wish for your own language).

* Only translated files are kept in the <lang> directories and the repository.
* The build script (Makefile and make.bat) have an option (init) to preprocess
  the <lang> directories. That means that each not translated English file is
  copied to the target <lang> directory. You don't have to do this to build
  html files locally. If you do this, you have to clean up you directories
  afterwards.
* To keep the translations in sync with the English documentation, the translators
  can monitor commits to the repository.

.. note::

    One way to monitor changes is to subscribe the RSS feed through GitHub: 
    in the MapServer-documentation repository, click on the "Commits" tab and look for a 
    subscription link for these commit changes, for example:
    see "Commit History" at https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer-documentation/commits/main

* You have to define which languages are available by setting TRANSLATIONS in the
  Makefile or make.bat:

   ::

      TRANSLATIONS     = en de

The build script will then process the subdirectories *en* and *de*. If they
are not accessible, an error message will be returned.

The standard internationalization system (i18n) for translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Initial translation process for a new language
..............................................

It follows steps below:


* Generate pot file from original English documentation using Sphinx (except 
  if already here)

   ::

      make gettext

* copy new version of \*.pot files from _build/gettext/en to translated/pot

   ::

      make gettext_copy


* Copy \*.pot file => \*.po file (a \*.po file is the same as \*.pot, only 
  extension change and if you translate three languages, you will get 
  three \*.po file and each of them will be into a language dir)

   ::

      make generate_po_from_tmpl -e TRANSLATIONI18N=fr

* translate your \*.po file(s)

  You can do it with software like PoEdit but we may switch to Transifex, 
  an hosted translation service to make contribution more easy, follow 
  translation advance and have a review process for translation.

* compile \*.po to \*.mo (sphinx need \*.mo file to make substitution from 
  original version to the language translated)

   ::

      make compile_messages -e TRANSLATIONI18N=fr

* Generate doc for the language


You just need to set in the file `Makefile` or make.bat depending on your OS
the following parameter before building the documentation:

   ::

      TRANSLATIONI18N=fr

You need to change as well the scripts/build_docs.sh script to add your language at 
the top of the file:

   ::

      LANGUAGES= fr

Please for both parameter, keep the alphabetical order to kept them readable.

**Structure of the i18n files in the MapServer-documentation root directory**

The structure you need to make all the transaltion process is like below (an 
excerpt to give you the main required structure)

   ::

      
      translated/
      ├── fr
      │   ├── about.po
      │   ├── announcements_all.po
      │   ├── cgi.po
      │   ├── community.po
      │   ├── copyright.po
      │   ├── development.po
      │   ├── documentation.po
      │   └── LC_MESSAGES
      │       ├── about.mo
      │       ├── announcements_all.mo
      │       ├── cgi.mo
      │       ├── community.mo
      │       ├── copyright.mo
      │       ├── development.mo
      │       └── documentation.mo
      └── pot
          ├── about.pot
          ├── announcements_all.pot
          ├── cgi.pot
          ├── community.pot
          ├── copyright.pot
          ├── development.pot
          └── documentation.pot

Moreover, you only need to commit the \*.pot and \*.po files.
Be cautious, you must have an LC_MESSAGES directory to receive \*.mo files.
To keep this directory in Git, it's recommended to create and empty file into 
it.

.. note:: When adding a new language, take care of the ISO code used. Famfamfam 
  flag icons is using ISO Country code, and transifex is using ISO Language code 
  which can be different. See `ISO country code page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>`_ 
  for more information.

The usual workflow for already existing translation
....................................................

The previous process we explained is only for the language creation. After, the 
workflow consists of:

* translating po files for your language via `transifex <https://www.transifex.com/organization/mapserver/dashboard>`_,
* pull po files from transifex and commit them
* generating the .mo files
* building again

Here are the command line:

* Getting po files from transifex (you can use -l flags to filter the language)::

    tx pull -a 
  
* Build mo files from po files::

    make compile_messages  -e TRANSLATIONI18N=fr

* Build html page::
  
    make clean html
    
See below how to setup your transifex account to use transifex client to push, 
pull translated files and build html files.

Sometimes, when a change occurs in the main english documentation, you will 
need to generate again the pot files. Then, you will have to merge your 
translated files with the new pot files using for example the command line 
utility (from gettext) below::

      make gettext
      make gettext_copy 	

.. we don't merge string anymore: msgmerge translated/fr/index.po build/gettext/en/index.pot -U -N

-U mean update po file with pot file and -N mean don't use fuzzy but exact match. 
Then push po files to transifex (you can use -l flags to filter the language)::

    tx push -s

When committing your update, add [build_pdf] or [build_translations] in order to 
build pdf and/or translation to the webserver.

**Knonw issues:**
 
* when downloading po files to local dir, if the file exists it won't be 
  updated. At this moment we should remove all po files before downloading.
* when building html doc cache system doesn't allow to update a page with up to 
  date translation. We should use the clean target with make.
* This command line throw an error::
  
    tx push -s -t

How to use Transifex client to manage translation process
...........................................................

.. NOTE::
   Transifex is described more in depth in the document: :ref:`documentation_translation`

* Install transifex client::

    sudo apt-get install transifex-client

* Edit ~/.transifexrc and add the appropriate info in there::

    vim ~/.transifexrc

  * With the following content::

     [https://www.transifex.com/]                                                                                                                                                                                                 
     username = yjacolin
     token =
     password = passw0rd!
     hostname = https://www.transifex.com/

Reference Labels
----------------

.. include:: ../include/labels.inc


Regenerating the reference labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can regenerate the reference labels by issuing:

::

    make labels

from the MapServer-documentation directory similar to when you are building the html or latex versions
