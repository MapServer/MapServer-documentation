Background
==========

The purpose of the following document is to outline the proposed timeline 
for the upcoming MapServer 8.0 major release.  Users planning on upgrading 
to 8.0 are also recommended to review the :ref:`MapServer Migration Guide <migration>`, 
as it will be updated for the 8.0 release.

Planned Dates
=============

We will plan for 2 betas and 1 release candidate (RC) over a 3 week period 
after the code freeze (1 beta/RC per week each Friday). This will lead us 
to a final release sometime around 2021-10-01:
