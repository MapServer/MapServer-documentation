MS RFC 141: MapServer CONFIG MS_ONLINERESOURCE
================================================

:Author: 	Seth Girvin

:Version: 	MapServer 8.8
:Status: 	Proposed

Overview
--------

This RFC proposes adding a new environment variable, ``MS_ONLINERESOURCE``, to
the MapServer :ref:`CONFIG file <config>`.

The variable acts as a global fallback when no service-specific
``*_onlineresource`` metadata (defined in the Mapfile
:ref:`mapfile-web-metadata`) is provided. For background on service-specific
usage, see :ref:`online_resource_wms`.

The ``*_onlineresource`` settings define the public-facing URLs that MapServer
advertises in GetCapabilities and related responses for accessing its OGC
services (WMS, WFS, WCS, OGC Features API, etc.). These URLs are consumed by clients and must resolve correctly.

Introducing a global ``MS_ONLINERESOURCE`` addresses the following issues:

1. Mapfiles currently require service-specific ``*_onlineresource`` values, 
   or an ``ows_onlineresource`` to be modified for each deployment environment
   (for example, local development, staging, and production).
   This RFC allows these environment-specific settings
   to be defined once in a single ``CONFIG`` file.

2. When a Mapfile does not define ``*_onlineresource`` metadata, MapServer
   attempts to construct the service URL from request headers and server
   variables. This approach can produce incorrect or inconsistent URLs in more
   complex deployments, particularly when reverse proxies are used. As a
   result, explicitly defining ``*_onlineresource`` metadata is currently
   strongly recommended.

Current Implementation
----------------------

When a Mapfile does not define ``*_onlineresource`` metadata, MapServer uses
the ``msBuildOnlineResource()`` function (in ``maputil.c``) to construct the
base **online resource URL**.

The URL is generated dynamically from CGI request data and server environment
variables, and relies on CGI and proxy headers; this can produce incorrect
results in some server or reverse-proxy configurations.

The function determines the URL components as follows:

- **Hostname**

  - Uses ``HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST`` if present
  - Falls back to ``SERVER_NAME``
  - If multiple forwarded hosts are provided, only the first is used

- **Port**

  - Uses ``HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT`` if present
  - Otherwise uses ``SERVER_PORT``

- **Protocol**

  - Defaults to ``http``
  - Uses ``https`` if ``HTTPS=on`` or ``SERVER_PORT=443``
  - ``HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO`` overrides all other logic

- **Path**

  - Uses ``SCRIPT_NAME``
  - Appends ``PATH_INFO`` if present

- **Query parameters**

  - If the request is a GET request and includes a ``map=`` parameter, it is
    appended as ``map=...&``

The port is omitted when it matches the protocol default (``80`` for HTTP,
``443`` for HTTPS); otherwise it is included explicitly.

The resulting URL has the general form:

::

  [protocol]://[hostname][:port][script][pathinfo]?[map=...&]

Examples:

::

  https://maps.example.com/mapserv?
  https://maps.example.com/mapserv/ogc?map=/data/example.map&
  http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/mapserv?

If the hostname, port, or script name cannot be determined, the function
fails with a CGI error:

::

  Impossible to establish server URL.


Proposed Implementation
-----------------------

Users will be able to add the new environment variable to the ``CONFIG`` file as follows:

::

  CONFIG
    ENV
      MS_ONLINERESOURCE "http://localhost/test/"

Notes:

- Existing ``*_onlineresource`` metadata in a Mapfile will take precedence over
  the ``CONFIG`` setting.

- If ``MS_ONLINERESOURCE`` is set to an empty string, the resulting base URL
  will be empty. Users are responsible for providing a valid URL for their
  environment.

- There are no plans to support separate ``MS_ONLINERESOURCE`` values for
  different services. While this could be useful in some scenarios, having
  multiple variables such as ``MS_WMS_ONLINERESOURCE`` or
  ``MS_WFS_ONLINERESOURCE`` would add unnecessary complexity.

Testing
-------

The ``msautotests`` test suite will be updated to validate various ``CONFIG`` 
and Mapfile setups, including:

- Cases with and without a ``MS_ONLINERESOURCE`` setting
- The case where ``MS_ONLINERESOURCE`` is set to an empty string

Security Concerns
-----------------

There are no known security concerns at the moment.

MapScript
---------

MapScript already supports ``CONFIG`` files, so no changes are required.

Example usage:

::

    # Create a new map object with a CONFIG file
    config = mapscript.configObj(r"C:\MapServer\apps\mapserver.conf")
    map = mapscript.mapObj(r"C:\MapServer\my.map", config)

    # The CONFIG file can also be passed to the fromstring helper method
    mapscript.fromstring("MAP NAME TEST END", r"C:/MapfileResources/", config_file)
