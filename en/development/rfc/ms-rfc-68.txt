:Status: Adopted (Implemented on 2011-03-04)
:Version: MapServer 6.0

Description: This RFC proposes an implementation for creating a new data
provider (CONNECTIONTYPE=UNION) which provides an option to represent features 
from multiple layers in a single layer.

1. Overview
-----------

Today, you can combine multiple files using a tileindex, but only if they have 
the same attributes, and description. In theory, it might be nice to be able to have 
multiple source layers that have similar attributes and to be able to combine them 
into a single layer (being called as union layer) using some compatible subset of the source 
column attributes so that the combined layer could be treated as a single layer. 
We could then use this single layer in the same way as any other layer when setting 
up the classes styles and labels. This layer could also provide the option to use 
features from multiple layers when configuring clustering support 
as per :ref:`MS RFC 69 <rfc69>`.

2. The proposed solution
------------------------

This functionality will be implemented as a separate layer data provider (CONNECTIONTYPE=UNION).
The union layer will use the CONNECTION parameter to define the source layers in the 
mapfiles as follows:

::

  LAYER
    CONNECTIONTYPE UNION
    CONNECTION "layer1,layer2,layer3" # reference to the source layers
    NAME "union-layer"
    PROCESSING "ITEMS=itemname1,itemname2,itemname3"
    ...
  END
  LAYER
    CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
    NAME layer1
    ...
  END
  LAYER
    CONNECTIONTYPE SHAPE
    NAME layer2
    ...
  END
  LAYER
    CONNECTIONTYPE SHAPE
    NAME layer3
    ...
  END


The new layer data provider will work in the following way:

1) In LayerOpen, it will open all of the source layers specified by the CONNECTION parameter
2) The LayerWhichShapes call will be delegated to the underlying layers and provide the rectangle
   for the area of interest
3) LayerNextShape will iterate through the layers and call LayerNextShape for the subsequent shapes.
   The layer index is assigned to the tileindex of the returned shapes. If we finish retrieving the
   shapes from one layer we start retrieving the features from the next source layer.
4) LayerGetShape will identify the layer based on the tile index and then call LayerGetShape of this layer

The union layer and the source layers must have the same geometry type otherwise an error is generated in
the LayerOpen call.

2.1 Handling the layer attributes (items)
-----------------------------------------

In general the source layers must provide those attributes which are required when 
rendering the union layer, however the underlying data may contain further attributes, 
which are not used when fetching the data from the original source.
When all attributes are requested (in the query operations) then the union layer will 
provide only some aggegated attributes (like the layer name or the group name of the source 
layer the feature belongs to). 
The set of the items can manually be overridden (and further attributes can be exposed) 
by using the existing ITEMS processing option.
At this stage of the development, the driver will expose the following additional attributes:

1) Combine:SourceLayerName - The name of the source layer the feature belongs to
2) Combine:SourceLayerGroup - The group of the source layer the feature belongs to

2.2 Projections
---------------

It is suggested to use the same projection of the union layer and the source layers. The layer provider
will however support transforming the feature positions between the source layers and the union layer.

2.3 Handling classes and styles
-------------------------------

We can define the symbology and labelling of the union layers in the same way as 
any other layer by specifying the classes and styles. In addition we will also support 
the STYLEITEM AUTO option for the union layer, which is essential if we want to display 
the features in the same way as with the source layers. The source layers 
may also use the STYLEITEM AUTO setting if the underlying data source provides that.

2.4 Query processing
--------------------

The driver will create (and operate on) a copy of the source layers which will allow to
keep the underlying layers open until the union layer is open. This will provide the 
single pass query to work in case if the source layer supports it.
The queries on the union layer will anyway behave the same like with the other layers.

3. Implementation Details
-------------------------

In order to implement this enhancement the following changes should be made in the MapServer codebase:
   
1) Modify the lexer to interpret the new connection type (UNION).
2) Implement mapunion.c containing the code of the union layer data source.

3.1 Files affected
------------------

The following files will be modified/created by this RFC:

::

  maplexer.l (maplexer.c)
  mapserver.h
  Makefile.vc
  Makefile.in
  mapunion.c (new)

3.2 MapScript Issues
--------------------

The connection type of this new layer will be exposed in the MapScript interface.
No further impact is taken into account at the moment.

3.3 Backwards Compatibility Issues
----------------------------------

This change provides a new functionality with no backwards compatibility issues being considered.
