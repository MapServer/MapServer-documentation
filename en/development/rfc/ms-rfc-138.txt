MS RFC 138: Reference SLD files in Mapfiles
================================================

:Author: 	Seth Girvin

:Last Updated:  2024-02-08
:Version: 	Targeting MapServer 8.4
:Status: 	Draft

1. Overview
===========

This proposal outlines how Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) files could be referenced directly in a Mapfile, allowing styles
to be applied using SLD files rather than MapServer's ``CLASS`` and ``STYLE`` blocks.

This would allow easier creation of Mapfiles from other applications, such as QGIS, which could export a Mapfile referencing
SLD files, rather than attempting to translate QGIS styles directly to MapServer Mapfile syntax. It would make it easier to reuse
styles between different applications.

It is proposed that the LAYER's :ref:`STYLEITEM <mapfile-layer-styleitem>` keyword is used to reference the SLD files, as in
the example below:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      STYLEITEM "sld://mysldfile.xml" # uses SHAPEPATH and if not set then relative path to the Mapfile or absolute path
      CLASS # define an empty CLASS here
      END
    END

The mechanisms to load and apply a file from disk referenced in a Mapfile could also be used in the future to apply future
styling formats for example e.g. OGC styling could use file://style.json. 

2.1 Proposed Solution
=====================

In MapServer 6.6 the LAYER :ref:`STYLEITEM <mapfile-layer-styleitem>` property was updated to allow a path to a JavaScript file
that would return a string containing a STYLE or CLASS definition. See :ref:`STYLEITEM JavaScript <styleitemjs>` for more details. 
The same approach will be taken for SLD files, so no new Mapfile keywords or concepts are required. 

MapServer currently supports drawing layers in a Mapfile using SLD files in the following scenarios:

+ When applying SLD from a client application using the ``SLD_URL`` and ``SLD_BODY``
  parameters to a MapServer layer - see the :ref:`SLD docs <sld>`
+ When using the :ref:`WMS client <wms_client>` - ``wms_sld_body`` can be used to specify SLD to apply to the WMS
+ When using the :ref:`WMS client <wms_client>` - ``wms_sld_url`` can be used to specify a URL pointing to an SLD file

Currently ``msSLDApplySLDURL`` saves an SLD file a URL to a temporary file, and then applies this SLD to the layer. 
Much of the code is already available and can be reused to implement applying SLD directly from a file.

2.2 Limitations
===============

Currently all uses of SLD rely on the NamedLayer Name property matching the LAYER NAME. For example
``popplace`` in the SLD file:

.. code-block:: xml

     <NamedLayer>
        <Name>popplace</Name>

Will only be applied if the LAYER NAME, or WMS name are also ``popplace``:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER "popplace"
    METADATA
        "wms_title" "popplace" # this property is also checked for a match
    END

If an SLD file is defined within a layer, it is proposed there is no need for the NamedLayer property to match the LAYER NAME.
This would allow SLD files to be more easily reused, and would avoid confusion as to why the SLD isn't being applied when specified
in the Mapfile. 

MapServer supports applying multiple NamedLayers to a LAYER, by creating a copy of the layer and applying subsequent NamedLayer styles
to these copies. It is proposed only one NamedLayer will be applied to a LAYER when defined as a file in the STYLEITEM property. 
Cloning layers already containing a STYLEITEM will make the code overly complex, and a Mapfile author is free to create as many LAYERs
in the Mapfile as they wish. If multiple NamedLayers are contained in the SLD file only the first will be used. 

2.3 Testing
===========

Mapfiles and sample SLD files will be created and added to the msautotest test suite. There are several conflicting features that will
need to be tested. Tests will include:

+ Applying SLD to a LAYER
+ Checking an error is returned if the SLD file cannot be found
+ Checking if multiple NamedLayer files are contained in an SLD file only the first is used
+ Checking SLD is applied even if the LAYER NAME doesn't match the NamedLayer Name
+ Checking Legends are correctly generated
+ Checking SLD can be supplied from a URL or querystring to override the SLD in the STYLEITEM

Reviewing SLD support in MapServer highlighted several use cases which do not currently have tests. Tests may be added as
part of this implementation. These include:

+ Using ``wms_sld_body`` in a WMS client
+ Using ``wms_sld_url`` in a WMS client

Several other SLD tests however are provided:

+ Passing SLD via ``sld_body`` in a querystring is tested in many cases for example ``msautotest/wxs/wms_sld.map``
+ Passing in an SLD URL is tested in ``msautotest/sld/linemark.map``

2.4 Security Concerns
=====================

MapServer already accepts SLD from remote URLs and client requests, so local SLD files shouldn't cause any concerns.

2.5 MapScript
=============

MapScript currently includes an ``applySLD`` function on both Map and Layer objects. 
The ``layerObj`` also includes a ``styleitem`` property which can be used to set the :ref:`STYLEITEM <mapfile-layer-styleitem>` property.

3. Implementation Details
=========================

3.1 Affected files
------------------

+ mapdraw.c
+ maplayer.c
+ mapogcsld.cpp

More files may be affected once implementation is underway. 

3.2 Ticket Reference
--------------------

TODO - add GitHub pull request URLs.

3.3 Documentation
-----------------

Documentation will be added to the :ref:`STYLEITEM <mapfile-layer-styleitem>` docs. 
A link to these docs will also be added to the "Other Items Implemented" section on the :ref:`SLD docs <sld>` page.
