MS RFC 89: Layer Geomtransforms
=========================================================================

:Date:  2013/02/05
:Author: Alan Boudreault
:Contact: aboudreault at mapgears.com
:Status: Adopted and Implemented
:Version: MapServer 6.4

1. Overview
-----------

MapServer 6.0 introduced the concept of geometry expressions within a styleObj-geomtransform. For
example, one could write:

::

  STYLE
    GEOMTRANSFORM (buffer([shape], -5)
    ...
  END

This would cause a buffer operation to be run on the shape before being rendered
with a given style. However, if we want to work with the transformed shape and
apply multiple styles, the performance of the rendering will be signicantly
affected since the geom transform have to be done on each style. There are some
other cases a layer geom transform would be useful. In example, if we want to
simplify our lines.

This is a proposal to add a the ability to set a geomtransform at the layer
level. For more information about the geomtransform implemented for the style
object: see https://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-48.html.

2. The proposed solution
------------------------

This RFC proposes the addition of a new layer option: GEOMTRANSFORM. The
functionality is mostly the same than the the style geomtransform, except that
not *all* the parameters will be implemented. Unless we really see a need for
the following transformations at the layer level, they *won't* be implemented:
bbox, start, end, vertices. All other parameters will be accepted (EXPRESSIONS).

To set a geomtransform to a layer, you just need to add this option in the mapfile:

::

  LAYER NAME "my_layer"
    TYPE LINE
    STATUS DEFAULT
    DATA "lines.shp"
    GEOMTRANSFORM (simplify([shape], 10))
    CLASS
      STYLE
        WIDTH 2
        COLOR 255 0 0
      END
    END

.. note::

  Note that the layer geomtransform and the style geomtransform are
  completely independent. Both can be used in your layer/class
  definitions and they will be applied properly.

2.1 Implementation Details
---------------------------

Layer geomtransform would support all query requests. The logic of the
geomtransform will be done in msLayerNextShape() and msLayerGetShape()
functions. This would allow a user to interact with transformed
features. ie. mapscript, WFS.

2.2 Unit Coordinates
--------------------

There is a particularity between STYLE and LAYER GEOMTRANSFORM. STYLE-level
GEOMTRANSFORM receives a shape in pixel coordinates, whereas the LAYER-level
GEOMTRANSFORM will receive the raw shape in ground coordinates (meters, degrees,
etc.). The argument to methods such as simplify() must be in the same units as
the coordinates of the shapes at that point of the rendering workflow,
i.e. pixels at the STYLE-level and in ground units at the LAYER-level.

::

  LAYER NAME "my_layer"
    TYPE LINE
    STATUS DEFAULT
    DATA "lines.shp"
    GEOMTRANSFORM (simplify([shape], 10))  ## 10 ground units
    CLASS
      STYLE
        GEOMTRANSFORM (buffer([shape], 5)  ## 5 pixels
        WIDTH 2
        COLOR 255 0 0
      END
    END
  END

It is also not possible at all to deal with values in ground units at the style
level because we do not have information about map cellsize at that level in the
code

2.3 Pixel value at Layer level
-------------------------------------------------

In cases where we want to pass a pixel value at the layer level, a
[map_cellsize] variable will be available.

::

  LAYER NAME "my_layer"
    TYPE LINE
    STATUS DEFAULT
    DATA "lines.shp"
    # 10 * [map_cellsize] == 10 pixels converted to ground units
    GEOMTRANSFORM (simplify([shape], [map_cellsize]*10))
  ... 

To get this variable working in the math expression parser, the [map_cellsize]
has to be converted into the layer ground unit. If you choose to use [map_cellsize]
in your GEOMTRANSFORM expression, you must explicitly set the UNITS option in 
the layer. 

2.4 Vector formats supported
-------------------------------

All vector formats will be supported. This also include all formats of OGR
(CONNECTIONTYPE OGR).

3. New Geomtransform Parameters
-------------------------------

3 new parameters will be added as a geomtransform parameter:

- simplify: Simplify using GEOS. More info: `GEOS Simplify <http://geos.refractions.net/ro/doxygen_docs/html/classgeos_1_1simplify_1_1DouglasPeuckerLineSimplifier.html>`_
- simplifypt: SimplifyPreserveTopology using GEOS. More info: `GEOS SimplifyPreserveTopology <http://geos.refractions.net/ro/doxygen_docs/html/classgeos_1_1simplify_1_1TopologyPreservingSimplifier.html>`_
- generalize: Custom implementation of the following algorithm: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/966

Those parameters will be available through the style geomtransform as
well. Here is an example of the simplifypt geomtransform (the blue line is the
original shape and the red one the transformed shape):

4. MapScript
-------------

The ability to get/set the layer-level geomtransform will be added to
mapscript. The geomtransform is handled internally and does not affect anything
else.

5. Backwards Compatibility Issues
---------------------------------

This change provides a new functionality with no backwards
compatibility issues being considered.

6. Tests
--------

msautotest will be modified to add some tests of this new functionality.
