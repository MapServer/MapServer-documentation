:Version: MapServer 7.0

1. Overview
-------------

UTFGrid is a open solution for specifying raster interaction data. The goal being to provide highly scalable user
interaction with raster maps. The objective of this RFC is to enable MapServer to produce UTFGrid output. 

The UTFGrid encoding scheme encodes interactivity data for a raster tile in a space efficient manner. It is designed to be used in browsers, e.g. for displaying tooltips when hovering over certain features of a map tile.

Since slower browsers and machines can't cope with rendering the actual polygons used to draw vectors on the map tile, we use a grid-based approach where we store the associated information for each pixel. UTFGrid uses JSON as a container format.

The full spec and interactive demos are available at https://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec.

2. Proposed solution
--------------------

This work would add the ability to write UTFGrids (JSON) as output from a normal map draw operation, that is, via 
CGI mode=map or WMS GetMap requests.

2.1 Rendering the UTFGrid
-------------------------

New UTFGrid renderer that would utilize the AGG library using an unsigned int32 canvas to encode feature IDs as their
literal UTF-8 respresentation. Feature IDs (starting at 1) would be assigned sequentially as features are rendered  
and a reference to the feature's key would be maintained as part of the rendering process. The list of feature keys 
will be searched first to avoid duplication. It is certainly reasonable to define a key for feature that respresents a
thematic property, for example population age class, which would result far smaller output than keys that are unique 
to each feature. A layers key item is defined by the new UTFITEM attribute.

The UTFRenderer will draw points, lines and polygons based loosely on the underlying style definition.

::

  Polygons: solid fill.
  Lines: solid line with width. Patterns are not applied.
  Points: rectangle based on the bounding box of the symbol will be used.

Labels can be rendered using their parent feature id (derived via features UTFITEM) where the labels bounding box is
drawn to the map. It is also possible to choose the resolution of the grid. A larger resolution will make the grid 
smaller and therefore reduce its weight but also its precision. These are optionals capabilities which can be enabled 
through the output format:

::

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "myUTFGrid"
    DRIVER UTFGRID
    FORMATOPTION "LABELS=true"
    FORMATOPTION "UTFRESOLUTION=4"
    FORMATOPTION "DUPLICATES=false"
  END

It may be desirable NOT to remove duplicate feature id/key pairs since that process could be expensive depending
on the number of features in the map. The format option duplicates=false can be used to skip this step. The resulting
JSON file will be a bit larger.

Note: due to upcoming changes to text rendering, Truetype symbols and labels rendering aren't implemented yet and should
be added in the future.

2.2 Exposing Feature Properties
-------------------------------

A new layer element (UTFDATA) is added to allow the creation of simple JSON templates using MapServer
expression syntax identical to what is used with classObj->text class text syntax. UTFDATA is of type
expressionObj. If UTFITEMs is set the UTFDATA expose those so that keys and data can be connected.

If a UTFITEM is not set the sequential id (based on rendering order) is being used.

Examples:

::

  UTFITEM "fid"
  UTFDATA "{\"id\":\"[fid]\", \"name\":\"[name]\", \"country\":\"[country_code]\", \"area\":\"[area]\"}"

::
    
  # no UTFITEM    
  UTFDATA "{\"name\":\"[name]\", \"country\":\"[country_code]\", \"area\":\"[area]\"}"

If no UTFDATA is provided no data beyond the UTFITEM values will be exposed and sometimes this is all that
is required. 

UTFGrids can be set on multiple layers but only one UTFGrid can be rendered at a time. If you wish to 
add multiples UTFGrid, with for example OpenLayers, you need to add new layer in the map for each of them.

2.3 Examples
------------

This is how the output format should look like.

::

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "utfgrid"
    DRIVER UTFGRID
    MIMETYPE "application/json"
    EXTENSION "json"
    FORMATOPTION "UTFRESOLUTION=4"
    FORMATOPTION "DUPLICATES=false"
  END

And this is how the new UTFITEM and UTFDATA word should be added in the layer.  
  
::

  LAYER
    NAME         basic
    DATA         ne_50m_admin_0_countries
    TYPE         POLYGON
    PROJECTION
      "init=epsg:4326"
    END
    UTFITEM   "postal"
    UTFDATA   "{\"admin\":\"[admin]\"}"
  END

Here is an image rendered as a JSON with UTFGrid renderer:

::

  [
    "                            &&&&",
    "                       && &&&&&&",
    "                     &&&&&&&&&&&",
    "                   &&&&&&&&)))))",
    "                  &&& &&&)))))))",
    "                    &&&&))))))))",
    "                   &&&&)))))))))",
    "                 &&&&)))))))))))",
    "                &&&&&)))))))))))",
    "               &&&&&))))))))))))",
    "              &&&&&&))))))))))))",
    "            &&&&&&))))))))))))))",
    "         &&&&&&&&)))))))))))))))",
    "       &&&&&&&&&&)))))))))))))) ",
    "    &&&&&&&&&&&&&))))))))))))   ",
    "   &&&&&&&&&&&&&&)))))))))))    ",
    "   &&&&&&&&&&&&&&)))))))))))    ",
    "   &&&&&&&&&&&&&&)))))))))))    ",
    "   &&&&&&&&&&&&&&))))))))))))) !",
    "   &&&&&&&&&&&&&)))))))))))))))!",
    "    &&&&&&&&&&&&))))))))))))))  ",
    "    &&&&&&&&&& )))))))))))))))  ",
    "    &&&&&&&&   ))))))))))))     ",
    "       &&    $$ ))))))))))  ))) ",
    "          $$$$$$))))))))))) ))) ",
    "         $$$$$$  )))))))))) )   ",
    "         $$$$$$ $)))))))))      ",
    "         $$$$$$$$$))))          ",
    "         #$$$$$$$$))))$         ",
    "         ##$$$$$$$###    ''''''(",
    "          ###########'''''''''''",
    "    %%%%#############'''''''''''"
   ]

And now we get the following keys and datas if we use the UTFITEM with the postal code as the key :

::

  "keys":["","AI","D","DK","NL","N","PL","RUS","S"],"data":{"AI":{"admin":"Aland"},"D":{"admin":"Germany"},
  "DK":{"admin":"Denmark"},"NL":{"admin":"Netherlands"},"N":{"admin":"Norway"},"PL":{"admin":"Poland"},
  "RUS":{"admin":"Russia"},"S":{"admin":"Sweden"}}

And if we turn off the UTFITEM we obtain the following keys and datas:

::

  "keys":["","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"],"data":{"1":{"admin":"Aland"},"2":{"admin":"Germany"},
  "3":{"admin":"Denmark"},"4":{"admin":"Netherlands"},"5":{"admin":"Norway"},"6":{"admin":"Poland"},
  "7":{"admin":"Russia"},"8":{"admin":"Sweden"}} 
  
It is also possible to only keeps the UTFITEM which returns : 

::

  "keys":["","AI","D","DK","NL","N","PL","RUS","S"],"data":{}

3. Implementation Details
-------------------------

Additions:

- there are two new keywords (UTFDATA and UTFITEM) that exists at the layer-level
- one new renderer (UTFGRID) will be made available

Known limitations of the initial implementation produced during GSoC:

- Attribute values are not JSON-escaped, so the JSON output could be broken if the attribute values contain invalid characters. A JSON escaping function should be added for UTFGrid and would also be useful for general template support of JSON output.

- Due to the upcoming changes to TrueType rendering, the renderTrueTypeSymbols method has not been implemented yet. All other types of symbols and labels are implemented.

4. Files affected
------------------

The following files will be modified/added by this RFC:

::

  mapserver.h: Add new output format defines, extend layerObj, etc... 
  mapfile.c/mapfile.h: Add new keywords: UTFITEM and UTFDATA.
  mapoutput.c: Add appropriate entries for new UTFGRID driver.
  maputfgrid.cpp/maputfgrid.h: Implementation of the new UTFGrid renderer.
  mapaggcommon.h: Common resources for AGG and UTFGrid drivers.

5. OpenLayers
-------------

There is a patch submitted to the OpenLayers development team allowing use of UTFGrid on a WMS service. It is required in order to use the MapServer implementation of UTFGrid with OpenLayers

You can find it at https://github.com/fdesj/openlayers in the utfgridwms branch. See also pull request at https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/1076

There is a working example in the OpenLayers library (exemples/utfgridwms.html).

6. MapScript
-------------

PHP MapScript will need get/set methods added to the layer class. Swig-based MapScript should need no changes.

7. Backwards Compatibility Issues
---------------------------------

None anticipated.

8. Security implications
-------------------------

None anticipated.

9. Performance implications
---------------------------

No impacts on core performance are anticipated.

10. Documentation needs
------------------------

The layer object documentation will need to be updated to reflect the new parameters. The output section will need a new UTFGrid HowTo page to talk about configuration options associated with the new output format.
