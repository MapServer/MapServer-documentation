:Version: 	MapServer 8.0
:Status: 	Adopted

.. NOTE::  
   This document is outdated, please follow the official document: :ref:`FlatGeobuf <flatgeobuf>`

1. Background
=============

 :class: no-scaled-link

FlatGeobuf is an optimized binary encoding for vectors based on 
`Flatbuffers <https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/>`__, 
that focuses on read/query performance by leveraging a 
`Packed Hilbert R-Tree <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_R-tree#Packed_Hilbert_R-trees>`__
spatial index, that enables fast bounding box spatial filtering.  
FlatGeobuf performance has helped make it become one of the
chosen formats for streaming spatial data through HTTP / "the cloud". 
 
2. Current Status through OGR
=============================

.. seealso:: :ref:`FlatGeobuf in MapServer <flatgeobuf>`

- Since GDAL 3.1.0, FlatGeobuf access is available in MapServer through `OGR <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/flatgeobuf.html>`__

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
    CONNECTION "name.fgb"
    DATA "layername"
    CONNECTIONOPTIONS
      "VERIFY_BUFFERS" "NO" # for maximum performance
    END
    
- There is some performance overhead connecting through OGR.  The following
  rudimentary benchmark shows some overhead for shapefile through OGR ::
  
     Shapefile (native) 0.010s
     FlatGeobuf (OGR)   0.013s
     Shapefile (OGR)    0.023s
     GeoPackage (OGR)   0.042s
     SpatiaLite (OGR)   0.045s
     PostGIS (native)   0.053s
     GeoJSON (OGR)      0.089s
     
     environment: MapServer-main + GDAL 3.4.3 (MS4W/Windows)

3. Proposed enhancement
=======================

- add FlatGeobuf as a native format for MapServer

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    CONNECTIONTYPE flatgeobuf
    DATA "name.fgb"

- FlatGeobuf C++ implementation is small and doesn't require any
  dependencies
- Flatbuffers source will be included
- initial implementation will be read access only

3.1 Backwards Compatibility
===========================

Not applicable

3.2 Performance Implications
============================

As mentioned above, this should give a performance boost by reading 
direct from the FlatGeobuf file.  More benchmarks will be included here 
during the testing of this Pull Request.  For example, here is an 
updated benchmark run on 2022-05-16 (note that this is for world extents, 
with country labels) :

::
  
     FlatGeobuf (native) 0.008s
     Shapefile (native)  0.010s
     FlatGeobuf (OGR)    0.013s
     Shapefile (OGR)     0.023s
     GeoPackage (OGR)    0.042s
     SpatiaLite (OGR)    0.045s
     PostGIS (native)    0.053s
     GeoJSON (OGR)       0.089s
     
     environment: MapServer-main + GDAL 3.4.3 (MS4W/Windows)

3.3 Limitations
===============

1. This will be read access only, initially.  This means that tricks such as
   setting an OUTPUTFORMAT for direct FlatGeobuf output from MapServer, will
   only work through OGR, for now.
   
2. The *VERIFY_BUFFERS* driver option of FlatGeobuf is not implemented 
   through this native driver (it is exposed through the OGR connection 
   in MapServer, if need be).  Specifically this means that currently 
   the value of *VERIFY_BUFFERS* is equivalent to *NO* for this native 
   driver, at the moment.

3.4 Security Concerns
=====================

There are no known security concerns at the moment.

3.5 MapScript 
=============

The new format has been exposed through *layerObj->setConnectionType()*.
   
4. Implementation Details
=========================

4.1 Affected files
------------------

- new files will be stored in: */flatgeobuf/*

- included files will be stored in: */flatgeobuf/include/*

- *mapflatgeobuf.c*: main logic

- *mapfile.c*: add new CONNECTIONTYPE

- test has added in */msautotest/misc/flatgeobuf.map*

- MapScript test has been added in */msautotest/php/layerObjTest.php*
