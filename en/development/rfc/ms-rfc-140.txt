MS RFC 140: MapServer Homepage
================================================

:Version: 	MapServer 8.6
:Status: 	Draft

1. Overview
===========

This RFC proposes adding functionality to MapServer for dynamically generating a homepage that lists all map services available in a given deployment. 
This feature would enable the creation of pages like https://maps.isric.org/ directly from a MapServer deployment, without requiring 
additional scripting. While scripting can achieve this, integrating the capability into MapServer itself 
would offer greater convenience and maintainability.

With the introduction of the :ref:`CONFIG file <config>` in MapServer 8.0, it is now possible to centrally manage information about all Mapfiles in a deployment. 
This would ensure that the homepage remains automatically synchronised with both the CONFIG file and the capabilities of the Mapfiles it references.

2.1 Proposed Solution
=====================

A new MapServer :ref:`CGI mode <cgi>` - ``mode=config`` will be added to allow details of the MapServer services to be returned. The ``MAPS`` block 
in the :ref:`CONFIG file <config>` will be read to return a list of available services. By default the homepage service will be disabled unless a new
``ENV`` option ``MS_HOMEPAGE_TEMPLATE`` has been set. This should be set to a folder containing a ``homepage.html`` value. However if only JSON
responses are required it can be set to any value to enable the homepage service.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    ENV
        MS_HOMEPAGE_TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY "share/ogcapi/templates/homepage/" # REQUIRED
        ...
    END
    # Example MAPS block in the CONFIG file
    MAPS
        TEST_MAPFILE1 "/opt/mapserver/test/test1.map"
        TEST_MAPFILE2 "/opt/mapserver/test/test2.map"
    END

Users will be able to request the Mapfile details in two formats - HTML and JSON. A parameter can be added to the querystring to choose the format - 
it is proposed the OGC API use of the ``f`` parameter is
used to select this, for example ``f=html`` or ``f=json``. As with the OGC Features API if not specified JSON will be the default.
Requests will look as follows:

.. code-block:: bat

    # example web requests
    # http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?mode=config&f=json
    # http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?mode=config&f=html

    # from the command line
    mapserv -nh "QUERY_STRING=mode=config&f=json" -conf "/usr/local/etc/mapserver.conf"
    mapserv -nh "QUERY_STRING=mode=config&f=html" -conf "C:\MapServer\apps\mapserver.conf"

As the service returns JSON any client-side library can be used to render the output. However a default HTML template  will be provided
following the same approach as in OGC Features API.

JSON Structure
--------------

JSON will be generated using the nlohmann/json and Inja approach already implemented in :ref:`MS RFC 134: OGC API Support <rfc134>`.
A proposed JSON structure is shown below. Final details may vary. URLs will be constructed based on settings in each individual Mapfile.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "id": "TEST_MAPFILE1", // the key in the config file
      "name": "My_Mapfile", // the NAME in the Mapfile
      "title": "My Mapfile Title", // the TITLE in the Mapfile
      "links": [
        {
            "href": "https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities",
            "title": "GetCapabilities",
            "type": "WMS"
        },
        {
            "href": "https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities",
            "title": "GetCapabilities",
            "type": "WFS"
        },
        {
            "href": "https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wcs?SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities",
            "title": "GetCapabilities",
            "type": "WCS"
        },
        {
            "href": "https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/mapserv/localdemo/ogcapi/api?f=html",
            "title": "Landing Page",
            "type": "OGCAPI"
        },
      ]
    }


Future Development
------------------

Once the general approach is in place more details could be added to this structure, such as the EXTENT and default PROJECTION. 
The OGC Features API JSON can be used as a guide to create the structure, for example for the extent:

.. code-block:: json

    "extent": {
        "spatial": {
            "bbox": [
                [
                    -180,
                    -90,
                    180,
                    90
                ]
            ],
            "crs": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84"
        }
    },

It may be beneficial to allow an administrator to choose what data is made available through the service. A similar approach to
the use of ``ows_enable_request`` could be considered. Additional links could include the OpenLayers Map (see :ref:`rfc63`).

Potentially the approach taken in this RFC could be used to return the same information for a single Mapfile, providing individual home pages
for each Mapfile.

2.2 Limitations
===============

Mapfiles will need to be listed in the ``MAPS`` block of the ``CONFIG`` file to be listed as part of the service.
There will be no support for reading all Mapfiles in a folder - this would be best handled by scripting the MAPS section of the
CONFIG file.

Available services such as WMS, WFS etc. will be checked for using the ``ows_enable_request`` in the ``METADATA`` section of a Mapfile, however there is no guarantee
that the URLs will return valid XML if the Mapfile is not configured correctly.

2.3 Testing
===========

``msautotests`` will be added to validate various CONFIG and Mapfile setups.

2.4 Security Concerns
=====================

This new feature will make services more discoverable, but with this comes the risk of leaking information.
The service will be opt-in, and up to the administrators of the deployment if they want this information to be
visible by setting the ``MS_HOMEPAGE_TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY`` value in the ``CONFIG`` file.

2.5 MapScript
=============

It is not planned to add MapScript support for this RFC.
None of the current MapServer ``mode`` functionality is supported in MapScript, nor the OGC Features API functions.

3. Implementation Details
=========================

This section contains notes from prototyping a possible solution. The final approach may differ. 

A requests will be checked for ``mode=config`` in mapserv.c to return JSON and exit.
A new mode will be added to ``mapservutil.c``

.. code-block:: c

    static char *const modeStrings[23]

To list services supported in a Mapfile ``msOWSRequestIsEnabled`` will be used:

- "AO", "OGCAPI"
- "M", "GetMap", "GetCapabilities"
- "F" (WFS) "GetCapabilities"
- "CO" "GetCapabilities"

Example ``int status = msOWSRequestIsEnabled(map, NULL, "AO", "OGCAPI", MS_FALSE);``

For constructing URLs ``msOWSGetOnlineResource`` will be used (which calls ``msBuildOnlineResource``
if ``ows_onlineresource`` (or ``wms_``, ``wfs_`` etc.) is not set.
