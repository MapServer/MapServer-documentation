1. Overview
-----------

For some applications, it is desirable to mask out one or more layers so
that only the features that intersect another set of features are rendered
in the returned image.
While it is relatively trivial to achieve this goal with sql joins if all
the data is stored in postgis, the task becomes much more evolved or even
impossible if the layer to be masked, or the layer to use as a mask, comes
from a shapefile or a raster datasource.

A example use-case for this could be rendering meteo data for a given
client, but only on the areas where the client has purchased the service.
In this case, the meteo data should only be rendered on the areas covered by
a set of polygons that represent the purchased areas.

Another example use-case given an input DEM raster, could be to only render
data where the elevation is comprised in a given range.

To achieve these goals, the present RFC proposes the introduction of "MASK"
layers, where only the features that intersect the given mask are rendered
onto the final image.

2. Proposed solution
------------------------

In order to work with all layer types, this RFC proposes to implement layer
masking at the pixel level, with the addition of a single "MASK" mapfile
keyword. The MASK keywords is placed at the layer level, and takes a single
argument which is the name of another mapfile layer that should be used as
a mask.

The mechanism to achieve masking at rendering time is:

- Each layer that is used as a mask is rendered in its own temporary image.
  All the filtering and styling is done as usual, which implies that raster
  classification/filtering can be performed, as well as style-level
  geomtransforms, etc...

- When a layer references a MASK, it is rendered in its own temporary image,
  in the same way that is done when OPACITY is set. As before, all kind of
  filtering/transformations can be performed on the masked layer

- The masked layer is blended onto the final map image, but only for the
  pixels that have been set in the mask image.

Example of MASK usage:

::

  LAYER
   NAME "parcels"
   TYPE POLYGON
   STATUS OFF
   DATA "the_geom from parcels where clientid='%token%'"
   CLASS
    STYLE
     COLOR 0 0 0
    END
   END
  END

  LAYER
   NAME "meteo"
   STATUS ON
   TYPE RASTER
   DATA "raster.tif"
   MASK "parcels"
  END

.. note::

   The layer used as a mask **will** be rendered in the final map image
   if its status is set to DEFAULT, or if its status is set to ON and the
   layer name is included in the requested layers. Most users of this
   feature will probably want to set the mask layer to STATUS OFF.


3. Implementation Details
-------------------------

- The parser will have a MASK keyword added to it, expecting a string
- The layerObj will have two properties added to it:
  
  - char* masklayer : the name of the layer that should be used as a mask
  - imageObj* maskimage : for a layer that has been referenced as a mask by
    another layer, this will contain the pixels that should be used to
    determine where data can be rendered on the final map image. This is to
    prevent the mask layer from being rendered multiple times if it is
    referenced by multiple layers.

- In msDrawLayer(), if the current layer references a MASK layer:
  
  - a temp image is created and rendered into by another call to
    msDrawLayer()
  - a temp image is created and rendered into following the same codepath
    as if layer->opacity has been set
  - the second temporary image's
    alpha channel is tampered with and set to 0 for all the pixels that haven't
    been set in the first temporary image.
  - the second temporary image is blended into the final map image, again
    following codepath as if layer->opacity has been set.

3.1 Files affected
------------------

The following files will be modified/created by this RFC:

::

  mapserver.h/mapfile.c/mapfile.h/maplexer.l/mapcopy.c: parser and new layerObj members
  mapdraw.c: implementation in msDrawLayer()
  maplabel.c: implementation for dropping labels from the labelcache if they don't
              intersect the mask layer in msAddLabel()

3.2 MapScript
-------------

Getters and Setters will have to be added to programmatically add a MASK to a layerObj.
No other issues are to be expected.

3.4 Backwards Compatibility Issues
----------------------------------

This change provides a new functionality with no backwards compatibility issues being considered.

4. Limitations
--------------

- Querying: The masking is done at the pixel level, as such all operations that query the
  datasource will not mask out features.
- Vector renderers: masking operations will not be supported on the vector renderers (svg,pdf)
- Labelling: Labelling is usually performed after all layers have been rendered, in the labelcache
  phase.
  
  - For layers that are referenced as a mask, the layer's labelcache will be set to OFF, which
    results in all labels being directly added to the temporary mask image instead of being added
    to the labelcache. Of course, it is not recommended to add labels to a layer used as a mask
    (that is, unless someone finds a compelling use-case to do so)
  - If the layer that is being masked has labels, these have the potential to be rendered outside the
    mask area if they go through the labelcache. To overcome this, there will be a test to ensure
    that the labelpoint is contained in the masked areas before adding it to the labelcache. Note that
    the label text itself might be rendered outside of the masked areas, but this should not be an
    issue. If the masked layer is set with LABELCACHE FALSE, the rendered labels will be filtered
    out automatically at the pixel level, although there will probably be truncated labels that
    can appear.

5. Error Handling
-----------------

There are no special cases to treat here aside from the classic ones (parsing errors, invalid
layer referenced by MASK, invalid renderer selected)
