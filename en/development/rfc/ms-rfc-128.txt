MS RFC 128: Make C99 and C++11 build requirements
=========================================================================

:Date: 2019-12-02
:Author: Even Rouault

:Status: Adopted
:Last update: 2019-12-11
:Version: MapServer 7.6

Overview
--------

MapServer currently requires C89 for its .c files and C++98/C++03 for its
.cpp files. We propose to bump the requirements to C99 and C++11.

This RFC is *not* about converting at once the whole code base to C99 or C++11,
but more about making it *possible* to do progressive porting where and
when it makes sense. Potential future larger changes of base data structures for
example will need to be addresed in dedicated RFCs.

More than a purely technical move, this is also intended to be an indication to
the community at large that MapServer can embrace "modern" technologies
(as far as one can consider standards of 9 or 20 years ago modern :-))

Rationale
---------

This has been discussed at length in projects that MapServer depends on, and
which have already adopted the above requirements:

- GDAL: https://gdal.org/development/rfc/rfc68_cplusplus11.html
- PROJ: https://proj.org/community/rfc/rfc-3.html
- GEOS: https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/RFC5

Proposed solution
-----------------

- In CMakeLists.txt, enforce C99 and C++11 requirements
- In CMakeLists.txt, bump minimum version of CMake to 3.0: this just reflects
  the current state of MapServer main which uses a 3.0 feature for Python
  mapscripts.
- Demo partial conversion in mapogcfiltercommon.c -> mapogcfiltercommon.cpp

Narrowing down C API
--------------------

mapserver.h exposes a (too) large amount of functions as exported, mostly
in mapserver.h, but also in other headers.
We believe that most of them are not intended for external consumption.
Such a large amount of exported functions can be an obstacle to refactoring
and C++'ification. Looking in the archive of all source code that Debian
maintains for "mapserver.h" only points to MapCache as including mapserver.h
( https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=mapserver.h )

We thus propose that removal of public symbols is permitted, provided that:

- MapServer binaries (mapserv, shp2img, etc...) and MapScript, which are the main
  users of the C API, still compile. If changes are needed in them and that they
  doesn't affect the user, they are permitted.

- MapCache still compiles. If changes would be needed in MapCache to compile,
  this must be discussed.

Backwards Compatibility Issues
-------------------------------

Obsolete environments where MapServer used to build and that have not natively
C99 support or C++11 will need to upgrade their toolchain.

On Windows side, this means Visual Studio 2015 or above.
For gcc, at least 4.8 is needed.

Current versions of Linux or Windows binary distribution we are aware of
have all the needed requirements. No change in the Travis and AppVeyor CI have
been needed to make the below proposed implementation work.

Security implications
---------------------

None.

MapScript implications
----------------------

None

Documentation needs
-------------------

https://mapserver.org/installation/unix.html and https://mapserver.org/installation/win32.html
will need to mention the new build requirements
