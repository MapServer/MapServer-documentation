MS RFC 85: Vector Contour Rendering (CONNECTIONTYPE CONTOUR)
=========================================================================

:Version: MapServer 6.4

1. Overview
-----------

This is a proposal to add the ability to compute and render contour layers on
the fly in MapServer from a raster source. The source is one band of raster
data, which represents a digital elevation model (DEM). More info about DEMs at:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model

Contours can already be rendered today using a standard vector layer but this
requires an extra processing step with gdal_contour to pre-generate the contours
from the raster source. Plus this also implies some overhead for the
gdal_contour files management, etc.


2. The proposed solution
------------------------

This RFC proposes the addition of a new type of layer in MapServer:
CONNECTIONTYPE CONTOUR. The new type is a hybrid layer, which has a raster data
source as input and vector features as output. Initially, only the line
representation of those vector features will be supported. 

Since the internal layer is of type vector, queries will be supported and
operate on the vectors (not on the raw raster source). In the future we might
see a need to add a query mode that queries the raster source, but this is not
included in this phase of work.

To render a contour layer, we need to define a layer in the mapfile with the
following options:

 * Set the layer TYPE to LINE.
 * Set CONNECTIONTYPE to CONTOUR.
 * Set the DATA to the raster file that contains the elevation band.
 * Specify the band to use as elevation using PROCESSING "BANDS", same as
   regular raster.
 * Specify one or more classes and styles to render the line features.

PROCESSING settings:

 These options should be specified at layer level:

 * CONTOUR_INTERVAL: elevation interval between contours
 * CONTOUR_LEVELS: comma-separated list of one or more 'fixed levels' to extract
 * CONTOUR_ITEM: provides a name for the item (attribute) in which to put the
   elevation. (optional)

  You can also provide explicit min/max scaledenom in the CONTOUR_iNTERVAL or
  CONTOUR_LEVELS values if you wish to use scale-dependent contour spacing. This
  is done by adding an optional "miscaledenom,maxscaledenom:" prefix to the
  value or list of values. See the example below.

Example of a simple layer definition:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LAYER NAME "my_contour_layer"
    TYPE LINE
    STATUS DEFAULT
    CONNECTIONTYPE CONTOUR
    DATA /mnt/data/raster/grib/dem.grib
    PROCESSING "BANDS=1"
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_ITEM=elevation"     
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_INTERVAL=10"
    CLASS
      STYLE
        WIDTH 2
        COLOR 255 0 0
      END
    END
  END #layer


Example of a layer definition with scale-dependent contour ranges:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LAYER NAME "my_contour_layer"
    TYPE LINE
    STATUS DEFAULT
    CONNECTIONTYPE CONTOUR
    DATA /mnt/data/raster/grib/dem.grib
    PROCESSING "BANDS=1"
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_ITEM=elevation"     
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_INTERVAL=0,25000:5" # interval of 5 for scales of 25000 or less
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_INTERVAL=25000,500000:10" # interval of 10 for scales in the 25000 to 500000 range
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_LEVELS=500000,0:10,25,50,100" # explicit list of levels for scales of 500000 and up
    LABELITEM "elevation"
    CLASS
      STYLE
        WIDTH 2
        COLOR 255 0 0
      END
      LABEL
        ...
      END
    END
  END #layer
  
3. Implementation Details
-------------------------

Internally, a CONTOUR layer will have its own renderer/driver code. It's an
hybrid layer because it reads the raster source and creates a vector dataset from
it. It uses the internal GDAL function GDALContourGenerate(). All other
functions behave like a vector layer. The layer can be drawn as a normal line
layer using whichShape, GetShape etc.

Basic internal draw process of a CONTOUR layer:

 1. whichShape() is called: the raster data source is read using the internal
    GDAL functions, an OGR dataset is stored in the internal layer structure.

 2. getShape() is called: loop through the OGR dataset and return the shapeObj
    (Line).

 3. MapServer draws its line feature as any other vector layer.

https://gdal.org/api/gdal_alg.html#_CPPv419GDALContourGenerate15GDALRasterBandHddiPdidPvii16GDALProgressFuncPv

3.1 OGR Input driver
----------------------

Once the raster source will be processed with gdal raster/contour functions, a
OGR DataSource will be stored internally using the "Memory" driver. Since
mapserver has already an OGR input-driver, it will be used to avoid unnecessary
code duplication and maintenance. A layerObj with connectiontype=MS_OGR will be
used internally to render/query the vector features.

A OGR Datasource using the "Memory" driver cannot be reopened and can only be
created. The msOGRLayerOpen() function will try to open the dataset. In this
case, our datasource is already opened. To solve this minor issue, the
connection pooling API will be used.

3.2 Resample and Reprojection
-----------------------------

The raster resample and layer reprojection will be supported. It will be
done in one of the two ways:

 * In GDAL functions during the raster processing. (resample + reprojection)
 * In MapServer, like any other vector layer. (reprojection) 

3.3 Labeling
------------

Since the layer is a line vector layer internally, the labeling is not affected
and will be rendered as normal.

3.4 Tile boundaries 
-------------------

After some review of the GDALContourGenerate algorithm, it has been determined
that the tile boundaries of the line should match properly. So this shouldn't be
an issue but will have to be tested.

3.5 Files affected
------------------

The following files will be modified/created by this RFC:

::

  mapserver.h/mapfile.c (Connection type CONTOUR support in the mapfile)
  mapcontour.c (new file for the CONTOUR renderer)
  maplayer.c (new layer type handling, virtual tables init etc.)
  maplexer.l (add additional CONTOUR keyword)

3.6 MapScript
-------------

No issue for any MapScript bindings. The CONTOUR layer is handled/rendered internally as
any other layer.

3.7 Backwards Compatibility Issues
----------------------------------

This change provides a new functionality with no backwards compatibility issues being considered.

4. Tests
--------

msautotest will be modified to add some tests related to that new layer type
rendering and queries.

5. Bug ID
---------
