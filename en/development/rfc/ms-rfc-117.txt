MS RFC 117: PHP 7 MapScript Support Through SWIG
================================================

:Author: 	Jeff McKenna
:Contact: 	jmckenna@gatewaygeomatics.com
:Last Updated:  2017-02-02
:Version: 	MapServer 7.2
:Status: 	Draft

1. Motivation
=============

The PHP 7.0.0 release in December 2015 was a substantial change in the backend 
structure and caused a complete break in builds for MapServer's PHP MapScript 
extension.  Packagers, site administrators, developers, and service providers 
are all impatiently awaiting the release of MapServer with PHP 7 MapScript 
support.

PHP 7 contains a whole new Zend engine (called "PHPNG", or 
PHP Next-Generation) designed to speed up PHP applications; PHP 7 boasts many 
improvements over PHP 5.6 including:

 - performance (boasting "up to twice as fast as PHP 5.6")
 - significantly reduced memory usage
 - consistent 64-bit support
 - many fatal errors converted to exceptions
 - new combined comparison (Spaceship) operator <=>
 - new null coalescing operator ??
 - anonymous classes
 - and more, see the `PHP 7 Migration Guide <http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.php/>`__

MapServer's several mapscripts (Java, Python, Csharp) use the `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`__ 
library (wrapper library used to convert code into other languages) to automatically 
generate the necessary mapscript code; the existing PHP MapScript extension 
however does not use SWIG and was custom written at the time.  MapServer's Project 
Steering Committee (PSC) has also discussed the possibility of leveraging SWIG for 
the longterm support of PHP MapScript.  

The SWIG team has recently added support for PHP 7 in their development sandbox, 
it passes all of SWIG's test suite, and has been well received by the community.

2. Proposed enhancement
=======================

Remove the custom extension code for PHP from MapServer, and enable SWIG for 
generating the PHP MapScript extension, by using the latest SWIG development
version with MapServer's wrapper `mapscript.i`.  SWIG would automatically 
generate a PHP extension that contains most of MapServer's constants, objects, 
and methods. Similar to MapServer's other SWIG-based languages, any custom 
PHP classes or functions would be defined in the new file `/mapscript/php/phpextend.i`


2.2 Backwards Compatibility
===========================

This change should automatically support both the PHP 5 and 7 series.  At some point
the SWIG team will remove support for PHP 5 (they are discussing this now), but
likely it would match the `PHP 5.6 Security Support timeline <http://php.net/supported-versions.php>`__ 
(until 2018-12-31).

To handle any possible issues of compatibility in the short term:

1. All SWIG PHP code will live in its own directory: **/mapscript/phpng/**

2. The module will be named **phpng_mapscript.so** or **phpng_mapscript.dl**

2.3 Performance Implications
============================

As mentioned above, this should give a huge performance boost.

2.4 Limitations
===============

1. Packagers/packages relying on stable releases won't be likely to include SWIG-dev,
   until the official SWIG release contains PHP 7.
   
   Update: the recent official SWIG-3.0.11 release on 2016-12-29 now includes the PHP 7 support
   (see `announcement <https://sourceforge.net/p/swig/mailman/message/35575703/>`__)

2. During compile of the PHP MapScript extension through SWIG-dev, PHP's reserved 
   keywords for the functions "empty()" and "clone()" are automatically renamed by 
   SWIG to "c_empty()" and "c_clone()" for several MapServer objects, as follows:

   ::

    ..\..\mapserver.h(920) : Warning 314: 'empty' is a PHP keyword, renaming to 'c_empty'
    ..\swiginc\map.i(64) : Warning 314: 'clone' is a PHP keyword, renaming to 'c_clone'
    ..\swiginc\layer.i(128) : Warning 314: 'clone' is a PHP keyword, renaming to 'c_clone'
    ..\swiginc\class.i(122) : Warning 314: 'clone' is a PHP keyword, renaming to 'c_clone'
    ..\swiginc\style.i(122) : Warning 314: 'clone' is a PHP keyword, renaming to 'c_clone'
    ..\swiginc\shape.i(110) : Warning 314: 'clone' is a PHP keyword, renaming to 'c_clone'
    
   **This needs discussion, on how to handle that (document these changes in the SWIG API for PHP, 
   or change the underlying function names in the MapServer source)**

   Update: regarding the 'clone()' keyword, Java MapScript also faced this issue and solved it by redefining
   the functions, such as `cloneMap()` or `cloneLayer()`:

   .. code-block:: c

     #ifdef SWIGJAVA
       %newobject cloneMap;
       mapObj *cloneMap() 
     #else
       %newobject clone;
       mapObj *clone() 
     #endif
   
3. In downstream PHP scripts, users must include the SWIG-generated file `mapscript.php` before 
   calling any MapScript objects, as this file contains various constants and classes:

   .. code-block:: php
   
     <?php
     
       include("mapscript.php");
     
       $mapfile = "C:/ms4w/apps/gmap/map/swig.map";
       $oMap = new mapObj($mapfile);

4. In downstream PHP scripts, users will have to modify their syntax for declaring new objects, 
   such as:

   from:
   
   .. code-block:: php
   
     <?php
        
       $oMap = ms_newMapObj(MAPFILE);
       
   to:       
   
   .. code-block:: php   
   
     <?php
     
       include("mapscript.php");   
   
       $oMap = new mapObj(MAPFILE);
   
3. Implementation Details
=========================

3.1 Affected files
------------------

- mapscript.i: add reference to `phpextend.i`

- phpextend.i: can contain custom objects and methods needed, such as:

  + adding the MapScript information to the phpinfo() calls

    * PHP_MINFO_FUNCTION
  
  + properly initialize and close resources:

    * PHP_MINIT_FUNCTION
  
    * PHP_MSHUTDOWN_FUNCTION
  
    * PHP_RINIT_FUNCTION
  
    * PHP_RSHUTDOWN_FUNCTION
    
  + handle imageObj's output to STDOUT (currently extended for Python and Csharp only)
  
    *  imageObj->write()
  
  + other??

3.2 Tracking Issue
------------------

- current status: 

  * extension info is displayed properly through phpinfo()

  * map image can be generated with a PHP 7.0.14 script that simply loads
    a mapfile and saves the image file, on Windows
    
- todo:

  * modify Windows build scripts, for cmake
  
  * push all changes to sandbox
    
- code: https://github.com/jmckenna/mapserver/tree/phpmapscript-swig

- tests: need to update all of the existing PHP tests in /msautotest/php/

- ticket: https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues/5252

3.3 Documentation
-----------------

- Any changes to existing functions, or custom ones, will be added into the 
  existing `SWIG API <https://mapserver.org/mapscript/mapscript.html#swig-mapscript-api-reference>`__ 
  document

- the existing `PHP API <https://mapserver.org/mapscript/php/phpmapscript.html>`__ 
  document would contain a note mentioning deprecated for version >=7.2
