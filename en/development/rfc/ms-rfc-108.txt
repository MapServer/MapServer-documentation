1. Motivation
========================

Heatmaps are a popular method to represent sparse data on a regular raster
grid, where each pixel on the grid is influenced inversely to its distance to
each sample of the sparse dataset. They are usually represented with a
color-ramp where the hue encodes the density of the data sample, optionally
along with the intensity of an attribute. The "heatmap" term itself is used 
with varying meanings; in the context of this RFC, we will be using it to
reference `Kernel Density Estimation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_kernel_density_estimation>`_
maps.

This RFC proposes the addition of a vector to raster processing pipeline that
will transform an input vector source into a 1-band 8-bit raster that can then
be styled with mapserver's native raster handling.

2. Proposed Addition
====================

Adding a heatmap layer requires the following major changes to the mapserver
library:

- implementation of an "kerneldensity" connectiontype for raster layers, where
  the connection refers to another mapfile layer or group used as the vector
  datasource - implementation of the actual vector to raster transformation:

  - accumulate vertice in a 1-band floating point bitmap array
  - apply gaussian filtering to the bitmap, with a configurable radius
  - apply normalization to scale the bitmap cells to 8bits
  - create an in-memory GDAL datasource from the 8bit bitmap
- extend the raster RANGE support to allow for missing features usually needed
  for heatmap color ramps:

  - allow multiple ranges (to allow for color ramps with multiple stops)
  - allow color interpolation in HSL space instead of RGB
  - account for alpha values in color interpolation

2.1 Vector to raster operations
-------------------------------

The vector to raster pipeline is called from inside mapserver's high-level
raster handling when handling a layer with **CONNECTIONTYPE KERNELDENSITY**.
The output of this operation is a handle to a GDAL datasource that can then be
processed normally by the remainder of the raster handling code.

While a more generic API could be designed for handling this vector-to-raster
pipeline, the initial implementation will branch off to a heatmap specific
handler. Reflections on the design of such an API can be delayed until the need
for other vector-to-raster transformations arises, designing one for the scope
of this RFC seems like premature over-engineering.

The heatmap vector-to-raster takes the following parameters:

- **CONNECTION "layername"** : reference to the NAME or GROUP of a layer to use
  as an input vector datasource. NAME takes precedence, followed by the first
  layer from GROUP who's minscale/maxscale matches the current map scale. The
  referenced layer should probably a TYPE POINT layer. Other layer types will
  result in one sample being added for each vertex of the input features.
- **PROCESSING "KERNELDENSITY_RADIUS=10"** : radius in pixels of the gaussian
  filter to apply to the bitmap array once all features have been accumulated.
  Higher values result in increased cpu time needed to compute the filtered
  data. 

.. figure:: ../../images/heatmap-hsl-10.png
   :align: center

   result with a radius set to 10 pixels

.. figure:: ../../images/heatmap-hsl.png
   :align: center

   result with a radius set to 20 pixels

- **PROCESSING "KERNELDENSITY_COMPUTE_BORDERS=ON|OFF"** : A kernel of radius
  "r" cannot be applied to "r" pixels along the borders of the image.  The
  default is to extend the searchrect of the input datasource to include
  features "r" pixels outside of the current map extent so that the computed
  heatmap extends to the full extent of the resulting image. This can be
  deactivated when tiling if the tiling software applies a metabuffer of "r"
  pixels to its requests, to avoid the performance overhead of computing this
  extra information.

- **PROCESSING "KERNELDENSITY_NORMALIZATION=AUTO|numeric"** : if set to "AUTO",
  the created raster band will be scaled such that its intensities range from 0
  to 255, in order to fully span the configured color ramp. Such behavior may
  not be desirable (typically for tiling) as the resulting intensity of a pixel
  at a given location will vary depending on the extent of the current map
  request.If set to a numeric value, the samples will be multiplied by the
  given value. It is up to the user to determine which scaling value to use so
  the resulting pixels span the full 0-255 range; determining that value is
  mostly a process of trial and error. Pixels that fall outside the 0-255 range
  will be clipped to 0 or 255.

.. figure:: ../../images/heatmap-hsl-fix-scale.png
   :align: center

   fixed scaling applied. compared to the previous images, the greater number
   of red areas results from the fact that the chosen scaling factor made a
   large number of pixels overshoot the 255 limit

.. figure:: ../../images/heatmap-hsl-fix-scale2.png
   :align: center

   lower fixed scaling applied. no pixels have attained the 255 limit

2.2 Advanced sample weighting and filtering
--------------------------------------------

By default, each feature is assigned a weight of 1.0, and the resulting heatmap
will represent the spatial density of the vector features. If this is not the
desired behavior, different weights can be applied on a feature by feature
basis by using regular CLASS/STYLE syntax on the source vector layer. The
weight used will be read from the SIZE value of the matched STYLE. Standard
EXPRESSION and MIN/MAXSCALEDENOM apply; if a feature results in no matching
CLASS and/or STYLE, it is ignored and discarded from the resulting heatmap. The
examples at the end of this RFC give some examples as to how this can be
achieved.

.. figure:: ../../images/heatmap-hsl-density.png
   :align: center

   heatmap representing pure feature density when sample weighting or filtering
   are not applied, the actual vector points are represented alongside. (Other
   examples in this RFC are rendered with attribute weighting on each sample)

2.3 Raster Color Ramping
------------------------

The features added in :ref:`rfc6` for vector features, and since extended to
support raster layers, will be extended in order to support more complex color
ramps. Note that these additions will apply to all raster classifications, not
only for heatmap layers.

- **Support for multiple stops** : The actual support for ranges for raster
  layers is limited to a single COLORRANGE/DATARANGE. We will support multiple
  ranges in order to allow multiple color stops, and will also account for
  optional alpha values. The following example creates a ramp ranging from
  fully transparent blue to blue for values between 0 and 32, then blue to red
  for values ranging from 32 to 255.

  .. code-block:: mapfile

     class
       style
         COLORRANGE  "#0000ff00"  "#0000ffff"
         DATARANGE 0 32
       end
       style
         COLORRANGE  "#0000ffff"  "#ff0000ff"
         DATARANGE 32 255
       end
     end

  .. note::
  
     A single style block will be used for each pixel value. It is up to the
     user to ensure that the supplied DATARANGEs span 0 to 255 with no overlap,
     and that the chosen COLORRANGE stops are continuous from one stop to the
     next.

- **PROCESSING RANGE_COLORSPACE=RGB|HSL**: The current RANGE support
  interpolates colors between stops in RGB space, which usually results in
  washed out colors. The interpolation can be done in HSL space which usually
  results in wanted output for heatmaps.

2.4 Scaletoken Additions
------------------------

In order to easily adapt kernel density parameters depending on the actual
map scaledenom, the implementation of :ref:`rfc86` will be extended to also
replace tokens inside PROCESSING keys. See the examples at the end of this RFC
to see how this can be used in the context of heatmaps.

2.5 Backwards Compatibility
---------------------------

None expected. The behavior of the range support in RGB space is to extend the
color interpolation outside the supplied DATARANGE (for DATARANGEs that do not
span 0-255), whereas the behavior for HSL interpolation is to treat such values
as NODATA. Given that this behavior hasn't been officially formalized, it might
be wanted to modify the RGB interpolation so it behaves identically.

2.6 Performance Implications
----------------------------

The gaussian filter allocates two temporary float* bitmaps of the size of the
requested image, optionally expanded in case border computation has been
activated or not. For very large image requests this may result in large
allocations. The cost of the gaussian filtering is also dependent on the
chosen radius, 


2.7 Compatibility with tiling
-----------------------------

Options enabling tiling-compatible output have been added and must be used when
tiling. Failure to do so **will** result in tiles that are not consistent from
one another.

2.8 Example mapfiles
--------------------

.. code-block:: mapfile

  map
    size 1000 500
    extent -180 -90 180 90
    name "test heat"
    imagetype "png"

    web
      metadata
        "ows_srs" "epsg:4326  epsg:3857 epsg:900913"
        "ows_enable_request" "*"
      end
    end

    projection
      "+init=epsg:4326"
    end

    layer
      name "heatmap"
      type raster
      connectiontype kerneldensity
      connection "points"
      status on
      processing "RANGE_COLORSPACE=HSL"
      processing "KERNELDENSITY_RADIUS=20"
      processing "KERNELDENSITY_ATTRIBUTE=VAL"
      processing "KERNELDENSITY_COMPUTE_BORDERS=ON"
      processing "KERNELDENSITY_NORMALIZATION=AUTO"
      offsite 0 0 0
      class
        style
          COLORRANGE  "#0000ff00"  "#0000ffff"
          DATARANGE 0 32
        end
        style
          COLORRANGE  "#0000ffff"  "#ff0000ff"
          DATARANGE 32 255
        end
      end
    end
    
    layer
        name "points"
        status on
        type POINT
        data "pnts.shp"
     end
  end

With the addition of :ref:`rfc86` PROCESSING scaletokens, the kernel radius
can be set dynamically depending on the scale. Note that any other PROCESSING
key can be updated by the same method. In the following example, the kernel
radius will be of 50 pixels for scales 1/1 to 1/25000000, and of 10 pixels
for scales 1/25000000 and smaller:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    layer
      name "heatmap"
      ...
      processing "KERNELDENSITY_RADIUS=%radius%"
      SCALETOKEN
        NAME "%radius%"
        VALUES
          "0" "50"
          "25000000" "10"
        END
      END
      ...
    end

Different weights can be applied by using CLASS->STYLE->SIZE syntax on the
source vector layer to apply a non default weight to each sample:

- Weight read from a feature attribute:

  .. code-block:: mapfile
  
      layer
        name "points"
        status on
        type POINT
        data "pnts.shp"
        class
          style
            size [attribute]
          end
        end
      end

- Weight read from a non numeric attribute:

  .. code-block:: mapfile
  
      layer
        name "points"
        status on
        type POINT
        data "pnts.shp"
        classitem "risk"
        class
          expression "high"
          style
            size 5
          end
        end
        class
          expression "medium"
          style
            size 3
          end
        end
        class
          expression "low"
          style
            size 1
          end
        end
      end

3. Miscellaneous
================

3.1 Comments from the review period
-----------------------------------

- It was suggested that the color ramp used in the raster layer be defined by a
  static (png) image of exactly 256 pixels height instead of using
  CLASS->STYLE->COLORRANGE. This allows for easier visual generation of color
  ramps using standard image processing software.

- "radius" is the only parameter affecting the filtering kernel used. Providing
  a means to supply a hand-supplied kernel would be a feasible addition. More 
  discussion may be needed to determine an appropriate syntax.

- It was suggested to use a LINE or POLYGON's centroid as the resulting sample
  point instead of using each vertex. The resulting effect can be obtained by
  using layer level GEOMTRANSFORMs once they support the full range of
  available geomtransforms.

- It was proposed to use hand written formulas to determine the kernel radius
  and/or other filtering parameters. Introducing formula processing is out of
  scope of this RFC, and similar functionality can be achieved by using
  appropriate SCALETOKENS and/or weighing/filtering at the class->style->size
  level in the source vector layer.
