MS RFC 122: A Tool for Coverage Analysis of MapCache Multi-SQLite Caches
=========================================================================

:Date: 2018-07-26
:Author: Jerome Boue
:Version: MapCache 1.8

1. Motivation
==============

MapCache users may want to use offline a portion of a MapCache cache covering a
given geographical region. For that purpose, they need to identify relevant
files from an existing cache, check whether tiles are missing from these files
(possibly seeding missing parts if necessary), and extract these files to build
a new cache of the requested region.

The tool described in this RFC, named `mapcache_detail`, helps users with
some of these activities. It works with multi-SQLite caches where one single
file may contains thousands of tiles. It is able to:

  - Determine which SQLite files from the cache are needed to cover a given
    geographical region at a given zoom level range;

  - Count how many tiles are needed to cover the region and how many are
    already present in each file, giving a coverage ratio on file level, zoom
    level and global level;

  - Estimate data size of missing tiles, which need to be downloaded to
    entirely cover the requested region, again on file level, zoom level and
    global level.

`mapcache_detail` takes the form of an independent CLI executable using
MapCache library. It is proposed as a simple contribution to the MapCache
project under a `contrib/mapcache_detail/` folder, due to its specific
purpose (only SQLite caches are handled).

2. Supported SQLite Caches
===========================

The `mapcache_detail` tool supports:

  - :ref:`Single SQLite caches <mapcache_cache_sqlite>`,

  - :ref:`Multiple SQLite caches <mapcache_cache_multisqlite>`,

  - :ref:`Composite caches <mapcache_cache_composite>` composed of single
    and/or multiple SQLite caches.

3. Functionnal Overview
========================

From initial cache configuration, requested geographic region and zoom levels,
`mapcache_detail` finds out which SQLite files match said requested region.
Then for each SQLite file, the tool measures:

  - File size and number of tiles actually present in file, no matter their
    contribution to region coverage; these measures are used to estimate the
    mean size of a tile and the size of a cache fully covering requested
    region.

  - Number of tiles actually present in file and needed to cover requested
    region.

  - Number of tiles needed to cover requested region, present or not in file.
    These last two measures are used to determine coverage ratio of the cache
    relatively to requested region.

A report is then provided containing all measures for every SQLite file, and
combined at zoom level and global level. This report takes the form of JSON
data on standard output.

3.1 Input Parameters
---------------------

`mapcache_detail` needs two kinds of parameters:

  - Cache description, composed of:

      - MapCache configuration file of initial cache,

      - Layer, SRS and dimensions if needed,

      - A SQL query to count tiles in a rectangular area. This one is not
        needed if SQLite cache has been built with default settings of
        MapCache.

  - Region description, composed of:

      - Lowest and highest requested zoom levels,

      - Geometry of requested region, provided in one of the following formats:

          - *xmin*, *ymin*, *xmax*, *ymax* of the rectangle defining the region

          - a vector file specifying the region of arbitrary shape in one of
            the file formats supported by `OGR/GDAL`_ library.

Online help gives a description of available options to set input parameters. These options are similar to :ref:`mapcache_seeder's options <mapcache_seed>`:

.. code-block:: text

    $ mapcache_detail --help

    Usage:   mapcache_detail <options>

        -q | --query <value>
                    Set query for counting tiles in a rectangle. Default value
                    works with default schema of SQLite caches.
        -o | --short-output
                    Only Existing SQLite files are reported, missing SQLite
                    files are still Taken into account for level and global
                    coverage.

3.2 Identifying files and counting tiles
-----------------------------------------

To illustrate the process, here is an example of a fictional grid. Tiles are
represented by the smallest squares on the grid. Larger squares of 25 tiles
each represent SQLite files. Small indices denotes tile coordinates whereas
large indices denote databases coordinates. Colored rectangle represents
requested region for cache extraction. Darker tiles represent tiles present in
cache.

.. image:: ../../images/mapcache-detail.png
   :scale: 70%
   :class: no-scaled-link

Expressed in tiles, region coordinates *(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)* are
(11, 7, 27, 20). Expressed in SQLite files, these coordinates are (2, 1, 5, 4).
All files whose coordinates are comprised between (2, 1) and (5, 4) included
shall be part of the cache extraction. All tiles whose coordinates are
comprised between (11, 7) and (27, 20) included shall be counted for the region
coverage.

Following table gives tile count and coverage ratio of requested region,
according to tool's process:

3.3 Output Report
------------------

Tool's output, in JSON format,  provides user with SQLite file list to be
extracted from cache. Details are given on the number of tiles contributing to
region coverage. A synthesis is also given for each zoom level and at a global
level.

Following is a fictional example describing information present in tool's
output.

    }

4. Implementation details
==========================

4.1. Dependencies
------------------

|cJSON|_
   Output report is presented as a JSON document. Therefore `mapcache_detail`
   needs JSON printing features. For that purpose an off-the-shelf solution is
   proposed, namely `cJSON`_, available on GitHub through a MIT license.
   Anticipating integration of ElasticSearch Dimension back-end, (see
   :ref:`RFC-121 <rfc121>`) which also needs JSON, files `cJSON.h` and
   `cJSON.c` are simply copied in MapCache project, respectively in
   `include/` and `lib/` directories.

|OGR/GDAL|_, |GEOS|_
   In order to enter a non rectangular region defined with *xmin*, *ymin*,
   *xmax*, *ymax*, OGR/GDAL and GEOS third party libraries are needed. If these
   libraries are not available, this feature can be disabled at CMake stage
   with `-DWITH_GEOS=OFF -DWITH_OGR=OFF` arguments.

4.2. Build
-----------

`mapcache_detail` is automatically built when building MapCache with CMake,
see MapCache :ref:`mapcache_install` instructions.
