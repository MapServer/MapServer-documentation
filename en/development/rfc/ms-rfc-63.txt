:Version: MapServer 6.0

Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users often request for a simple way to test mapfiles. This RFC proposes a
**simple** way to preview, test and navigate a mapfile with MapServer using
a built-in OpenLayers based map viewer that will be triggered via the
cgi. This is for testing/development purposes only and not for production or
deploying full-featured sites. This will use the a built-in **openlayers**
template. It will return a simple html viewer based on OpenLayers.

Note that GeoServer already provides a similar functionality and this is
what this RFC was inspired from.


Implementation Details
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to implement this enhancement, the following changes should be
made in the MapServer codebase:


* Add a built-in **openlayers** template.

* Some new template tags will be needed. These tags will be used to
  construct the mapserver cgi url.

  - [mapserv_onlineresource]

    **or**

  - [protocol]
  - [host]
  - [program]
  
  See `ticket 3552 <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues/3552>`_ for more detail.


The template will be triggered using one of the following ways:

* Using **mode=browse&template=openlayers**: The viewer will be initialized
  based on the mapfile defaults, and some of the traditional mapserv CGI
  params may also work (such as map size, layer selection, etc.)

* Using **FORMAT=application/openlayers** in a WMS GetMap request: The rest of the GetMap
  parameters would be used to configure the map to view (BBOX, WIDTH,
  HEIGHT, LAYERS, etc.)

Both cases would call the same functions internally to produce a simple
OpenLayers viewer with one singletile layer for the whole map with the
selected layers.

Here's the simple viewer html code that could be used:

::

  <html>
  <head>
    <title>MapServer Simple Viewer</title>
      <script src="http://www.mapserver.org/lib/OpenLayers-ms60.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div style="width:[mapwidth]; height:[mapheight]" id="map"></div>
        <script defer="defer" type="text/javascript">
          var map = new OpenLayers.Map('map', 
                                       {maxExtent: new OpenLayers.Bounds([minx],[miny],[maxx],[maxy]), 
                                        maxResolution: [cellsize]} );
  
          var mslayer = new OpenLayers.Layer.MapServer( "MapServer Layer",
              "[mapserv_onlineresource]", 
               {layers: '[layers]'},
               {singleTile: "true", ratio:1} );
          map.addLayer(mslayer);
          map.zoomToMaxExtent();
        </script>
  </body>
  </html>



OpenLayers Dependency
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously, this functionality needs the OpenLayers javascript library. A
minimal build will be used and hosted on the MapServer website at
http://www.mapserver.org/lib/OpenLayers-ms60.js. The "ms60" suffix in the
OpenLayers-ms60.js filename is so that we can increase the version number
in the future if/when needed to match the requirements of future releases
of MapServer.

Users will also be able to use their own OpenLayers library in one of two ways:

* Using a environment variable: by setting the environment variable
  MS_OPENLAYERS_JS_URL, MapServer will use that url rather than the default
  one.

* Using a CONFIG setting in the mapfile: by adding the config variable
  MS_OPENLAYERS_JS_URL in a mapfile, MapServer will use that url rather than
  the default one.

Further Considerations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, we may provide a mechanism to support multiple frameworks
and ship generic templates with MapServer.
