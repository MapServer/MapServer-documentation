================================================
MS RFC 136: Rename shp2img to map2img
================================================

:Author:      Jeff McKenna
:Contact:     jmckenna@gatewaygeomatics.com
:Status:      Adopted
:Last update: 2021-10-07
:Version:     MapServer 8.0

Overview
========

The *shp2img* commandline utility has existed in the MapServer codebase 
since the first Open Source release, and although it was designed to do 
simple testing of mapfiles, today it has become a critical part of managing 
data in MapServer.  Through the years however many users have reported not 
understanding what `shp2img` means, as the name implies using legacy shapefiles & 
shapes.  

Proposed Approach
=================

Rename the *shp2img* utility to a more meaningful name of *map2img* (to imply 
that this utility can take a mapfile and output map images). The change has 
minimal impact to the source code, but has a large impact on the msautotest suite 
and the MapServer documentation.

The approach was initially discussed at the `2020-07-07 <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/wiki/PSC-Meeting-2020-07-07>`__
PSC meeting.

Source Files Changed
--------------------

* :shp2img.c: rename to *map2img.c*

  .. NOTE::
       After renaming, commit history is retained using the *--follow* switch through 
       git, such as the command: *git log --follow map2img.c*

Build Files Changed
-------------------

* :CMakeLists.txt: change build target name for the map2img utility.
* :mapserver-config.cmake.in: change executable name for the map2img utility.

msautotest Files Changed
------------------------

* :pymod/mstestlib.py: set [MAP2IMG] parameter
* :\*.map: point to map2img utility for all tests.

Limitations/Caveats
-------------------

There is an open `issue <https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/900>`__ 
of GitHub unable to show history of renamed files.

Backwards Compatibility Issues
------------------------------

This is a breaking change, in that the old utility *shp2img* will be changed 
to the name *map2img* and could cause some minor grief to users & packagers, 
therefore this is why this will be part of a major MapServer release.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

None anticipated.

MapScript implications
----------------------

None anticipated.

Documentation needs
-------------------

The *MapServer-documentation* repository will be updated for the name 
change.
