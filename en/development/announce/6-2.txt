 6.2 Announcement
*****************************************************************************

:Authors: Project Steering Committee
:Released: 2012-11-14

The MapServer Team is pleased to announce the long awaited release of MapServer 6.2.0
after an extensive beta phase.

After the 6.0 release that introduced important changes in key components under the hood
of the MapServer core, this 6.2 release brings a large number of new features that are 
summarized in this document.

Major New Features in MapServer 6.2
-----------------------------------

MapServer Suite
===============
This is the first joint release between MapServer 6.2, TinyOWS 1.1, and MapCache 1.0,
and is the first step towards a fully-fledged MapServer "Suite" integrating these 3
components. A source code archive containing all 3 components can be found in the
download links.

* **MapServer CGI and MapScript 6.2.0**
  The MapServer web mapping engine that has been at the core of the project since the
  beginning.

  .. seealso::

     :ref:`MapServer Documentation <documentation>`

* **WFS-T: TinyOWS 1.1**
  TinyOWS is a lightweight and fast implementation of the OGC WFS-T specification.
  Web Feature Service (WFS) allows to query and to retrieve features, and the 
  transactional profile (WFS-T) then allows to insert, update or delete such features.
  
  From a technical point of view WFS-T is a Web Service API in front of a spatial database;
  TinyOWS is deeply tied to PostgreSQL/PostGIS.
  
  .. seealso::
  
     :ref:`TinyOWS documentation <tinyows>`

* **Tiling: MapCache 1.0**

  MapCache is a high performance tiling server, that runs in native code either as a FastCGI,
  an Apache module, or an Nginx module. It supports a wide variety of protocols (WMTS, TMS,
  WMS, VirtualEarth, KML, ...) and storage backends (Disk, SQlite, Memcache, GeoTIFF files, 
  BerkeleyBD, ...), and provides options for dynamically responding to client requests by
  assembling cached tiles.
  
  .. seealso::
  
     :ref:`MapCache documentation <mapcache>`


INSPIRE View Services
=====================

MapServer 6.2 is :ref:`inspire_view_service` compliant, i.e. supports the 
provision of an INSPIRE View Service compliant :ref:`WMS_server`.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`INSPIRE View Service documentation <inspire_view_service>`

Mask Layers
===========

Mask layers are used to "mask out" part of a given layer, to only represent data that
intersect features from another layer. This can be typically used on land parcels, to
only display a base satellite image on the areas covered by the parcels of a specific
owner/customer.

Two layers are used in combination to activate this feature. The first layer is used
to render the features that will be used as a mask. It will typically use a FILTER to
only render a select number of features:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   layer
      name "countries"
      status off
      class
         expression ("[FIPS]" = "EZ")
         style
            color 0 0 0
         end
      end
   end

Note two things:

- The layer is set to STATUS OFF, as we do not want it rendered on the final map
  itself. In some use cases this might be set to STATUS ON.
- We have setup an EXPRESSION to only render the country who's code is "EZ". In
  a parcel scenario, this would typically be a list of parcels or the id of a 
  parcel owner.

The second layer is the layer that will be masked:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   layer
      status on
      name "naturalearth"
      mask "countries"
      type raster
   end

With these two layers, our "naturalearth" raster layer will only be rendered
on the pixels that intersect the "EZ" country from our countries layer.

This masking feature can be used on all the renderers that work on pixel data,
i.e. not for the pdf or svg renderers. In the case where the masked layer contains
labels, only the labels who's anchor falls inside the mask will be renderered. The
actual label text may itself overlap outside of the masked area.

.. seealso::

   `Mask renderer test mapfile <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/mask.map>`_
   and `Mask renderer resulting image <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/expected/mask.png>`_

Precise Symbol Placement
=========================

Traditionally, MapServer centers a marker symbol on the point it should be rendered
to. ANCHORPOINT is a new SYMBOL level keyword that describes where the given symbol
should be anchored.

.. code-block:: mapfile

  SYMBOL
    NAME "foo"
    TYPE TRUETYPE
    ANCHORPOINT 0 0 #will anchor the symbol on it's top-left
    ANCHORPOINT 0.5 0.5 #default, will center the symbol
    ANCHORPOINT 1 1 #will anchor the symbol on it's bottom right
    ...
  END

.. figure:: ../../images/anchorpoint.png
   :align: center

.. seealso::

   `Anchor point marker renderer test mapfile <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/marker_anchorpoint.map>`_
   and `Anchor point marker renderer resulting image <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/expected/marker_anchorpoint.png>`_

Complex Multi Label/Symbol Symbology
====================================

Some cartographic representations require juxtaposing multiple symbols and/or labels
in order to obtain a complex final symbol. Typically such needs can arise in the
meteorological field when creating observation maps, resulting in this kind of symbology:

.. figure:: ../../images/multilabel.png
   :align: center

In order to render these kind of symbols while avoiding collisions with neighbouring
symbols, MapServer `CLASS` elements now support multiple `LABEL` children, and the
`LABEL` element supports an `EXPRESSION` filter determining whether the label 
should be displayed or not. Inside a `LABEL`, a new `FORCE GROUP` parameter determines
if the current label is allowed to intersect other labels from the same feature or not,
and multiple `STYLE` blocks can be used to render graphic symbols instead of
or alongside the text. Note that this new feature will in practice make heavy use of
attribute binding to control symbol sizes and orientations.

.. seealso::

   `Multilabel renderer test mapfile <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/multilabel.map>`_

Vector Fields
=============

MapServer can render vector fields based off data from GDAL supported raster
formats containing `u` and `v` bands.

.. figure:: ../../images/uv.png
   :align: center

In order to support rendering arrowheads, the `STYLE` object now supports a
`POLAROFFSET r theta` entry, where the offset is given in polar coordinates
(i.e distance and bearing) rather than cartesian coordinates as for plain
`OFFSET`.

.. seealso::

   the :ref:`UVRASTER RFC <rfc78>`, the `test uvraster mapfile <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/uvraster.map>`_
   and the `resulting uvraster test image <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/expected/uvraster.png>`_


Label Leader Offsetting
=======================

For densely labelled maps, MapServer now supports offseting a label with respect to 
it's original anchorpoint if the original location resulted in a collision with an
already present label. An optional line can also be rendered to link the rendered
text to it's original feature location.

.. figure:: ../../images/label-leaders.jpg
   :align: center

In order to be able to offset complex symbols as defined previously, `LABEL` leaders
are defined at the `CLASS` level in their own `LEADER` block:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   class
      ...
      leader
         maxdistance 30
         gridstep 5
         style
            color 0 0 0
            width 1
         end
      end
      label
         ...
      end
   end

The configuration sets what is the maximum distance a label can be offsetted from its
original location, and the density of the grid where possible label positions are 
sampled when testing for collisions. The optional `STYLE` block is used to render
the line drawn from the feature to the offsetted label position.

Note that computing the positions of offsetted labels is computationally heavy and may
increase rendering times. To mitigate this, you can either apply this offsetting
to a select class of features, and/or diminish the the leader maxdistance, and/or
augment the leader gridstep.

   mapfile

SVG Symbology
=============

Along with the traditional ELLIPSE, VECTOR, PIXMAP and TRUETYPE symbols, MapServer 6.2
now supports SVG symbols directly, opening up new symbology usages with scalable and 
multicolor complex markers. SVG symbols are defined very classically by

.. code-block:: mapfile

  SYMBOL
    NAME "my-svg-symbol"
    TYPE SVG
    IMAGE "/path/to/svgfile.svg"
  END

Multiple Font Support
======================

No single truetype font contains all the glyphs of all the scripts of the world. When
rendering worldwide maps, it is thus needed to be able to specify multiple font files
from which to extract glyphs from. You can now give the LABEL's FONT a comma separated
list of fontset keys to try from, for each glyph to render MapServer will test each font
in turn until the requested glyph is found.

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LABEL
    TYPE TRUETYPE
    FONT "vera,arialuni,cjk,khmer"
    ...
  END

.. seealso::

   `Label multifont renderer test mapfile <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/label-multifont.map>`_
   and `Label multifon renderer resulting image <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/expected/label-multifont.png>`_


Minor New Features in MapServer 6.2
-----------------------------------

* **WMS Dimension Support**

  MapServer's WMS server now supports ELEVATION and DIM_* dimensions in addition to the 
  already existing TIME support. Head over to the :ref:`WMS dimension documentation <wms_dimension>`
  for more info.

* **Stable Hatching**

  MapServer's `HATCH` symbol will now create hatches that are contiguous across adjacent
  features and across different tiles.

* **XMP Metadata Support**

  :ref:`RFC <rfc76>` and :ref:`documentation <xmp_metadata>`

* **Support for Named Grouped Layers**

  The functionality of `wms_layer_group` is extended to support named 
  group layers as needed by the :ref:`inspire_view_service`. If a layer with 
  the same name as used in `wms_layer_group` is found it is treated as 
  named group and if no layer with this name is found as unnamed group as 
  before.

  .. seealso::

    :ref:`WMS Server documentation <WMS_server>`

* **Support for Generating Geospatial PDFs**

* **Initial Gap Support for Line Patterns**

  The line pattern used to style lines can now be precisely offseted with respect to the
  start of the line feature, allowing stable combinations of dashed patterns
   
  .. seealso::

     `Line pattern offset renderer test mapfile <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/line_pattern_offset.map>`_
     and `Line pattern offset renderer resulting image <https://github.com/MapServer/msautotest/blob/branch-6-2/renderers/expected/line_pattern_offset.png>`_

* **General Speedups and Memory Usage Optimizations**

  * Queries sent to postgis backend have been optimized to exercise eventual indexes that
    might have been set on the time column.
  * The Postgis driver cuts down on the dynamic memory allocations necessary for simple features.
  * The labelcache rendering phase has been sped up and consumes less memory.
  * If using proj version 4.8 or newer, MapServer will no longer use a thread lock before entering
    proj functions.


Noteworthy Changes Which Could Affect Existing Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Unix Build Procedure**

  * The configure script now accepts the traditional `--prefix` argument to determine where the
    libraries and executables should be installed.

  * Running `make install` as a privileged user is now **required** after a successful
    compilation, and the previous method of copying the `mapserv` binary from the source
    directory to the webserver's cgi-bin directory is highly discouraged. Instead, copy or
    symlink the installed binary from $prefix/bin.

  * The libmapserver library is now built as a shared library by default, instead of being
    statically linked in the mapserv, shp2img or mapscript libraries.

  * Installing multiple instances (with different capabilities for now, or for multiple
    versions in the future) can/must be done by specifying different `--prefix` entries
    for each instance, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ ./configure --without-gd --prefix=/opt/ms-62-nogd
       $ make && sudo make install
       $ ln -s /opt/ms-62-nogd/bin/mapserv /usr/lib/cgi-bin/mapserv
       $ make clean
       $ ./configure --with-gd --prefix=/opt/ms-62-gd
       $ make && sudo make install
       $ ln -s /opt/ms-62-gd/bin/mapserv /usr/lib/cgi-bin/mapserv-62-gd
   
 * PHP Mapscript builds are now enabled by configuring with `--with-php[=/path/to/php-config]`
 * Python Mapscript builds are now enabled by configuring with `--enable-python-mapscript`
   and eventually `--with-python=/path/to/bin/python` for non-standard python installs

* **GD support is now optional and disabled by default**

  The GD library is now an optional dependency and isn't enabled by default. If `--with-gd` is 
  not supplied to ./configure, `GD/*` outputformats will fall back to native AGG rendering.


* **ANNOTATION Layers are deprecated**
  
  Annotation layers are deprecated in 6.2 and will probably be removed in a future version.
  Identical functionality can be obtained by adding `LABEL` level `STYLE` blocks, and do not
  require loading the datasets twice in two different layers as was the case with ANNOTATION
  layers.

  .. note::

     MultiLabel Symbology and Offseted labels are not supported on ANNOTATION layers.

* **Support for GDAL older than 1.5.0 has been dropped**

Migration Guide
---------------

* **CGI**: Aside from the build procedure changes detailed above, there are no backwards
  compatibility issues we are aware of.
* **MapScript**:
  There is at least one incompatibility that has been encountered with
  MapScript vs the support for multiple label objects in a `class`. In 6.0 and
  older, `label` was an immutable member of the `class` object, and a single label
  was always allocated as part of the `classObj`. In 6.2, there is no label
  allocated in the class object by default and your MapScript code (python,
  etc.) has to create new label objects and add them to the class object. Three
  new methods were added to the `classObj` in MapScript to handle this: `getLabel`,
  `addLabel`, `removeLabel`. Existing scripts need to be updated or risk silent
  failures as SWIG MapScript (at least in python) does not complain on invalid
  access to the label member of the classObj.
