  `SLD: Improve WMS GetStyles request <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/pull/5832>`__.

- new processing directive `RENDERMODE` (added as part of :ref:`RFC 124 <paintersmodel>`) for a ‘painters model’

- WMS client layers can be set as essential through the new 'wms_essential' metadata

- Windows: mapfile paths and data filenames with special characters are now supported
