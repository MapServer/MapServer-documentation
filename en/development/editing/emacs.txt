mapserver-mode for Emacs
========================

There is a mapserver-mode for Emacs available at:
`https://github.com/AxxL/mapserver-emacs-mode
<https://github.com/AxxL/mapserver-emacs-mode>`__ This mode allows
syntax-highlighting and code-indentation when a MapServer mapfile is opened
in Emacs.

Please report issues directly via GitHub or via the mapserver-users
list. There are still some issues around.



Installation
============

You can grab the necessary file at:
`https://github.com/AxxL/mapserver-emacs-mode/blob/master/mapserver-mode.el
<https://github.com/AxxL/mapserver-emacs-mode/blob/master/mapserver-mode.el>`__

Put it into: $HOME/.emacs.d/lisp/

You need to add the following lines to your $HOME/.emacs.d/init.el

(autoload 'mapserver-mode "mapserver-mode" "Mode for editing UMN MapServer files." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.map\\'" . mapserver-mode))

If you haven't specified your load-path it is a good idea to do it now. Put
the following line before the other two lines.

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")

Some help for Emacs is available at the `Emacs Wiki <http://www.emacswiki.org/>`__



Background
==========

This file is a fork of Hal Muellers mapserver-mode which he announced nearly
`10 years ago at the mapserver-users list
<http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/mapserver-users/2004-May/051493.html>`__. I
simply updated the keywords and constants to the newest version and adjusted
the regular expressions a bit.

The original file seems to be based on the `Mode Tutorial by Scott Andrew
Borton <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ModeTutorial>`__. See also the
`Sample Major Mode example by Stefan Monnier
<http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SampleMode>`__ if you want to write your own
mode.

In combination with yasnippet and auto-complete-mode you should have a nice
way to edit mapfiles in your beloved Emacs environment.
