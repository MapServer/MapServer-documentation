`msautotest` is a suite of test maps, data files, expected result images,
and test scripts intended to make it easy to run an a set of automated
regression tests on MapServer.

Getting `msautotest`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skip this section if you've followed the :ref:`vagrant` steps.

`msautotest` is available from GitHub, and exists inside the *main*
MapServer repository, in /MapServer/msautotest/. It can be fetched with
something like::

    git checkout https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer.git

You will notice that an `msautotest` subdirectory (inside `MapServer`) 
exists after your checkout.

Running msautotest
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
   It is possible that some features tested through msautotest may not be released
   as part of MapServer yet, so be sure to test against today's main from MapServer's git.

If you're using Vagrant as described in :ref:`vagrant` everything is
installed and configured as needed and you may skip the next three
paragraphs.

msautotest can be run with either Python 2 or Python 3 (but does not require Python MapScript), 
so if you don't have Python on your system, get and install it. More information 
on Python is available at https://www.python.org. Most Linux system have some version
already installed.

msautotest also requires that the executables built with MapServer, notably
:ref:`shp2img`, :ref:`legend <legend_utility>`, :ref:`mapserv` and
:ref:`scalebar <scalebar_utility>`, are available in the path. This can be
accomplished by adding the MapServer build directory to my path.

csh::

 % setenv PATH $HOME/mapserver:$PATH

bash/sh::

 % PATH=$HOME/mapserver:$PATH

Verify that you can run stuff by typing 'shp2img -v' in the msautotest
directory::

     % shp2img -v
     MapServer version 7.6.0-dev OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=KML 
	 SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=AGG SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=CAIRO SUPPORTS=SVG_SYMBOLS 
	 SUPPORTS=SVGCAIRO SUPPORTS=ICONV SUPPORTS=FRIBIDI SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT 
	 SUPPORTS=WFS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WFS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WCS_SERVER SUPPORTS=SOS_SERVER 
	 SUPPORTS=FASTCGI SUPPORTS=THREADS SUPPORTS=GEOS SUPPORTS=POINT_Z_M SUPPORTS=PBF 
	 INPUT=JPEG INPUT=POSTGIS INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE

Starting with MapServer 7.6, you also need to install the `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_
framework to run the test. This can be done, from the `msautotest` subdirectory, with

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note:: pytest is already installed in Vagrant.


Now you are ready to run the tests. The tests are subdivided into categories,
each as its own subdirectory, such as:

::

  gdal
  misc
  mspython
  php
  query
  renderers
  sld
  wxs

You can run all tests with just `pytest` from `msautotest`
root directory. All standard options of pytest can be used to filter tests to
run, or adjust the verbosity level of the output.

The following custom options are also available:

::

  --strict_mode         Strict mode
  --valgrind            Run under valgrind
  --run_under_asan      Run under ASAN
  --renderer=RENDERER

To run the "gdal" tests cd into the gdal directory and run the run_test.py script.

.. note::
   Inside each folder ("gdal", "misc", etc.) you will first have to run
   the following, to download appropriate schemas: 
   
     `python ../pymod/xmlvalidate.py -download_ogc_schemas`

Unix::

  ./run_test.py
  
.. note::
   msautotest requires Python's `lxml` library for some of its functionality.
   Be sure to install it, such as: `apt-get install python-lxml`

Windows::

  python.exe run_test.py

The results in the gdal directory might look something like this::

 % run_test.py -vv

  Cannot validate XML because SCHEMAS_OPENGIS_NET not found. Run "python ../pymod/xmlvalidate.py -download_ogc_schemas" from msautotest/wxs

In general you are hoping to see that no tests failed.

Tests of a single .map file can be run by specifying the .map filename as
an argument of the run_test.py script.


Checking Failures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because most msautotest tests are comparing generated images to expected
images, the tests are very sensitive to subtle rounding differences on
different systems, and subtle rendering changes in libraries like freetype
gd, and agg. So it is quite common to see some failures.

These failures then need to be reviewed manually to see if the differences
are acceptable and just indicating differences in rounding/rendering or
whether they are "real" bugs. This is normally accomplished by visually
comparing files in the "result" directory with the corrresponding file in
the "expected" directory. It is best if this can be done in an application
that allows images to be layers, and toggled on and off to visually
highlight what is changing. QGIS can be used for this.


Background
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The msautotest suite was initially developed by Frank Warmerdam
(warmerdam at pobox.com), who can be contacted with questions it.

The msautotest suite is organized as a series of .map files. The python
scripts basically scan the directory in which they are run for files ending in
.map. They are then "run" with the result dumped into a file in the result
directory. A binary comparison is then done to the corresponding file in the
expected directory and differences are reported. The general principles for
the test suite are that:

- The test data should be small so it can be easily stored and checked out
  without big files needing to be downloaded.

- The test data should be completely contained within the test suite ... no
  dependencies on external datasets, or databases that require additional
  configuration. PostGIS and Oracle will require separate testing mechanisms.

- The tests should be able to run without a significant deal of user
  interaction. This is as distinct from the DNR test suite described in
  FunctionalityDemo.

- The testing mechanism should be suitable to test many detailed functions in
  relative isolation.

- The test suite is not dependent on any of the MapScript environments, though
  I think it would be valuable to extend the testsuite with some mapscript
  dependent components in the future (there is a start on this in the mspython
  directory).


Result Comparisons
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For shp2img tests The output files generated by processing a map is put in the
file results/<mapfilebasename>.png (regardless of whether it is PNG or not). So
when gdal/256_overlay_res.map is processed, the output file is written to
gdal/results/256_overlay_res.png. This is compared to
gdal/expected/256_overlay_res.png. If they differ the test fails, and the
"wrong" result file is left behind for investigation. If they match the result
file is deleted. If there is no corresponding expected file the results file
is moved to the expected directory (and reported as an "initialized" test)
ready to be committed to CVS.

For tests using RUN_PARMS, the output filename is specified in the RUN_PARMS
statement, but otherwise the comparisons are done similarly.

The initial comparison of files is done as a binary file comparison.  If
that fails, for image files, there is an attempt to compare the image checksums
using the GDAL Python bindings.  If the GDAL Python bindings are not available
this step is quietly skipped.

If you install the PerceptualDiff program (http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/) and
it is in the path, then msautotest will attempt to use it as a last fallback
when comparing images. If images are found to be "perceptually" the same the
test will pass with the message "result images perceptually match, though
files differ." This can dramatically cut down the number of apparent failures
that on close inspection are for all intents and purposes identical. Building
PerceptualDiff is a bit of a hassle and it will miss some significant
differences so it's use is of mixed value.

For non-image results, such as xml and html output, the special image
comparisons are skipped.



REQUIRES - Handling Build Options
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because MapServer can be built with many possible extensions, such as support
for OGR, GDAL, and PROJ.4, it is desirable to have the testsuite automatically
detect which tests should be run based on the configuratio of MapServer. This
is accomplished by capturing the version output of "shp2img -v" and using the
various keys in that to decide which tests can be run. A directory can have a
file called "all_require.txt" with a "REQUIRES:" line indicating components
required for all tests in the directory. If any of these requirements are not
met, no tests at all will be run in this directory. For instance, the
gdal/all_require.txt lists:

::

    REQUIRES: INPUT=GDAL OUTPUT=PNG

In addition, individual .map files can have additional requirements expressed
as a REQUIRES: comment in the mapfile. If the requirements are not met the map
will be skipped (and listed in the summary as a skipped test). For example
gdal/256_overlay_res.map has the following line to indicate it requires
projection support (in addition to the INPUT=GDAL and OUTPUT=PNG required by
all files in the directory):

::

    # REQUIRES: SUPPORTS=PROJ


RUN_PARMS: Tests not using shp2img
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is also a RUN_PARMS keyword that may be placed in map files to override
a bunch of behaviour. The default behaviour is to process map files with
shp2img, but other programs such as mapserv or scalebar can be requested, and
various commandline arguments altered as well as the name of the output file.
For instance, the following line in misc/tr_scalebar.map indicates that the
output file should be called tr_scalebar.png, the commandline should look like
"[SCALEBAR] [MAPFILE] [RESULT]" instead of the default "[SHP2IMG] -m [MAPFILE]
-o [RESULT]".

::

    RUN_PARMS: tr_scalebar.png [SCALEBAR] [MAPFILE] [RESULT]

For testing things as they would work from an HTTP request, use the RUN_PARMS
with the program [MAPSERV] and the QUERY_STRING argument, with results
redirected to a file.

::

    # RUN_PARMS: wcs_cap.xml [MAPSERV] QUERY_STRING='map=[MAPFILE]&SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities' > [RESULT]

For web services that generate images that would normally be prefixed with the
Content-type header, use [RESULT_DEMIME] to instruct the test harnass to
script off any http headers before doing the comparison.  This is particularly
valuable for image results so the files can be compared using special image
comparisons.

::

    # Generate simple PNG.
    # RUN_PARMS: wcs_simple.png [MAPSERV] QUERY_STRING='map=[MAPFILE]&SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCoverage&WIDTH=120&HEIGHT=90&FORMAT=GDPNG&BBOX=0,0,400,300&COVERAGE=grey&CRS=EPSG:32611' > [RESULT_DEMIME]

Result File Preprocessing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned above the [RESULT_DEMIME] directive can be used for image file
output from web services (ie. WMS GetMap requests).

For text, XML and HTML output it can also be helpful to apply other
pre-processing to the output file to make comparisons easlier.   The
[RESULT_DEVERSION] directive in the RUN_PARMS will apply several translations
to the output file including:

- stripping out the MapServer version string which changes depending on build
  options and version.

- manipulating the format of exponential numbers to be consistent across
  platforms (changes windows e+0nn format to e+nn).

- strip the last decimal place off floating point numbers to avoid
  unnecessary sensitivity to platform specific number handling.

- blank out timestamps to avoid "current time" sensitivity.

In some cases it is also helpful to strip out lines matching a particular
pattern.  The [STRIP:xxx] directive drops all lines containing the indicated
substring.  Multiple [STRIP:xxx] directives may be included in the command
string if desired.  For instance, the error reports from the runtime
substitution validation test (misc/runtime_sub.map) produces error messages
with an absolute path in them which changes for each person.  The following
directive will drop any text lines in the result that contain the string
ShapefileOpen, which will be error messages in this case::

 # RUN_PARMS: runtime_sub_test001.txt [MAPSERV] QUERY_STRING='map=[MAPFILE]
 &mode=map&layer=layer1&name1=bdry_counpy2' > [RESULT_DEVERSION] [STRIP:ShapefileOpen]


What If A Test Fails?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When running the test suite, it is common for some tests to fail depending on
vagaries of floating point on the platform, or harmless changes in
MapServer. To identify these compare the results in result with the file in
expected and determine what the differences are. If there is just a slight
shift in text or other features it is likely due to floating point differences
on different platforms. These can be ignored. If something has gone seriously
wrong, then track down the problem!

It is also prudent to avoid using output image formats that are platform
specific. For instance, if you produce TIFF it will generate big endian on big
endian systems and therefore be different at the binary level from what was
expected. PNG should be pretty safe.

TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add lots of tests for different stuff!  Very little vector testing done yet.

- Add something to run tests on the server and report on changes.


Adding New Tests
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Pick an appropriate directory to put the test in. Feel free to start a new
  one for new families of testing functionality.

- Create a minimal map file to test a particular issue. I would discourage
  starting from a "real" mapfile and cutting down as it is hard to reduce this
  to the minimum.

- Give the new mapfile a name that hints at what it is testing without making
  the name too long. For instance "ogr_join.map" tests OGR joins.
  "rgb_overlay_res_to8bit.map" tests RGB overlay layers with resampling and
  converting to 8bit output.

- Put any MapServer functionality options in a # REQUIRES: item in the header
  as described in the internal functioning topic above.

- Write some comments at the top of the .map file on what this test is
  intended to check.

- Add any required datasets within the data directory beneath the test
  directory. These test datasets should be as small as possible! Reuse
  existing datasets if at all possible.

- run the "run_test.py" script.

- verify that the newly created expected/<testname>.png file produces the
  results you expect. If not, revise the map and rerun the test, now checking
  the results/<testname>.png file. Move the results/<testname>.png file into
  the expected directory when you are happy with it.

- add the .map file, and the expected/<testname>.png file to the
  repository when you are happy with them.  For example,

::

    % git add mynewtest.map expected/mynewtest.png
    % git commit -m "My new test" mynewtest.map expected/mynewtest.png

You're done!
