Introduction
*************

This chapter aims to explain how to help translating the documentation into 
another langage than english. Some langage are already enable for translating 
and some other not. Pleas see :ref:`documentation_translation_newlang` if 
needed.

This chapter is still in under writing. Please forget any errors you find here 
and please report them to the mapserv-dev list with a [doc] flag in the subject. 

The translation process have several steps:

* create a langage in Transifex
* add the new langage into the source repository
* add new translator to the langage group in Transifex
* translate each chapter
* pull each translated files into the langage dir from Transifex 
* and push them into doc repository
* build the documentation

This chapter describes how to ask a new langage, how to join a langage group 
and how to translate the documentation.

What is Transifex for?
***********************

Transifex is a croudsourcing translation web application. It allows project to 
let people easily translate documentation, website,	application.

It offers graphic interface for those of you who don't like command line but also 
some feature for those who love them.

Transifex helps translator to improve their translation with suggestion, glossary 
and proof reading process.

Starting with Transifex
************************

Subscribe to Transifex
-----------------------

You need to subscribe to Transifex before translating. Go to `Transifex subscribing page <https://www.transifex.com/signup/contributor/>`_ and create a new account.

If not already done, please login ;)

Find the project
----------------
There is several OSGeo projects hosted on Transifex, here are some of them:

* `MapServer <https://www.transifex.com/organization/mapserver/dashboard>`_
* `PostGIS <https://www.transifex.com/organization/postgis/dashboard>`_
* `QGIS <https://www.transifex.com/organization/qgis/dashboard>`_

You can find more in the Transifex website.

Each project have a news page to send some information to you, please, take 
some time to read them. You can also send some message to other to discuss on 
some topic.

Ask to join to a translator group
-----------------------------------

Clic on the link to acces to the dashboard of the MapServer project in Transifex (link above), 
then the langage you want to join and finally find the button *Join team*. You 
should now wait for the manager accept you in the group (let him the time to read 
your request, some of them could not have so much time).

Welcome to the translation team!

.. _documentation_translation_newlang:

Ask a new langage
******************

For MapServer project, asking a new langage will add a new langage group on Transifex 
and some stuff in the documentation repository. Don't need to ask on the mapserv-dev 
list (but we will be happy to receive some message or feedback from you).

Go to the MapServer dashboard on Transifex (see link above) and clic on 'Request langage':

.. image:: ../images/documentation/tr_newlangage.png

Creating a new langage by the manager should not be too long, actually as long 
as to accept you in the team.

Translation Process
*******************

Describing the translation process could be an awesome task, so we are just going 
to describe the short way and we let you discover all the features in Transifex.

Choose a file and translate
----------------------------

You are now formally a translator of the MapServer project on Transifex. So you 
should go to the dashboard of the project, choose your langage:

.. image:: ../images/documentation/tr_chooselang.png

Then select a file in the new interface:

.. image:: ../images/documentation/tr_choosefile.png

The new interface allow you to choose a string to translate - the toolbar allow you 
to filter untranslated or Unreviewed string:

.. image:: ../images/documentation/tr_translatingui.png

Clic on the string on the left, translate it where 'Type your translation here' 
appears in the screenshot above. When finished clic on *Save*. Suggestion or 
glossary appear sometime on the right panel to help you.

In the untranslating string field, you have severa tools:

* Duplicate : copy past the english string into the translated file (sometim used 
  to let the translator easily duplicate indentical string).
* Machine translation : never used, so I can't help on this ;)
* Revert : revert your translated string.

You have some keyboard shorcut:

* Tab : switch to new string and save your modification
* Alt-Shif D : review the string and go to the next string

Clic on the Shorcut button to the right to find:w
much more keyboard shorcut.

Proof reading
--------------

Proof reading is similar to translation process, except that you should be 
reviewer to do it and you should clic on the *Review* button instead of 
save button.

Please don't review the string you translated or wait for some time before 
to be sure that you don't miss some errors.

FAQ
****

Why don't I see my translation into the MapServer website?
-------------------------------------------------------------

We need to push your translation into the doc repository then build again the 
documentation. This is not an automatic task so there is some delay between 
your file editing and the time where you can see them in the website.

You can send an email to the mapserver-dev list to ask for someone to do the 
pull/push process for the translation.
