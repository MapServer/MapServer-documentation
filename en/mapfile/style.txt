*****************************************************************************
 STYLE
*****************************************************************************

Style holds parameters for symbolization and styling.  Multiple styles
may be applied within a :ref:`CLASS` or :ref:`LABEL`.

This object appeared in 4.0 and the intention is to separate logic
from looks.  The final intent is to have named styles (**Not yet
supported**) that will be re-usable through the mapfile. This is the
way of defining the appearance of an object (a :ref:`CLASS` or a
:ref:`LABEL`).

ANGLE [double|attribute|AUTO]
    Angle, given in degrees, to rotate the symbol (counter clockwise).
    Default is 0 (no rotation).  If you have an attribute that
    specifies angles in a clockwise direction (compass direction), you
    have to adjust the angle attribute values before they reach
    Mapserver (360-ANGLE), as it is not possible to use a mathematical
    expression for `ANGLE`.

    - For points, it specifies the rotation of the symbol around its
      center.
    - For decorated lines, the behaviour depends on the value of
      the `GAP` element.

      - For negative `GAP` values it specifies the rotation of the
        decoration symbol relative to the direction of the line.
        An angle of 0 means that the symbol's x-axis is oriented
        along the direction of the line.
      - For non-negativ (or absent) `GAP` values it specifies the
        rotation of the decoration symbol around its center.
        An angle of 0 means that the symbol is not rotated.
    - For polygons, it specifies the angle of the lines in a HATCH
      symbol (0 - horizontal lines), or it specifies the rotation
      of the symbol used to generate the pattern in a polygon fill
      (it does not specify the rotation of the fill as a whole).
      For its use with hatched lines, see Example #7 in the
      :ref:`symbology examples <sym_examples>`.
    - [*attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the
      attribute to use for angle values. The hard brackets [] are
      required. For example, if your data source has an attribute
      named "MYROTATE" that holds angle values for each feature, your
      STYLE object for hatched lines might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        STYLE
          SYMBOL 'hatch-test'
          COLOR 255 0 0
          ANGLE [MYROTATE]
          SIZE 4.0
          WIDTH 3.0
        END

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.
    - The `AUTO` keyword was added in version 5.4, and currently only
      applies when coupled with the `GEOMTRANSFORM` keyword.

    .. note::

      Rotation using `ANGLE` is not supported for :ref:`SYMBOL`\s
      of `TYPE` `ellipse` with the GD renderer (gif).

ANGLEITEM [string]
    ANGLE[attribute] must now be used instead.

    .. deprecated:: 5.0

ANTIALIAS [true|false]
    Should TrueType fonts be antialiased.  Only useful for GD (gif)
    rendering.  Default is false.  Has no effect for the other
    renderers (where anti-aliasing can not be turned off).

BACKGROUNDCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to use for non-transparent symbols.

COLOR [r] [g] [b] | [attribute]

    - Color to use for drawing features.  `r`, `g` and `b` shall be
      integers [0..255].  To specify green, the following is used:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

         COLOR 0 255 0

    - [*attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the
      attribute to use for color values.  The hard brackets [] are
      required.  For example, if your data set has an attribute named
      "MYPAINT" that holds color values for each record, use:
      object for might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

         COLOR [MYPAINT]

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.

GAP [double]
    `GAP` specifies the distance between `SYMBOL`\s (center to center)
    for decorated lines and polygon fills in layer `SIZEUNITS`.  For
    polygon fills, `GAP` specifies the distance between `SYMBOL`\s in
    both the X and the Y direction.
    For lines, the centers of the `SYMBOL`\s are placed on the line.
    As of MapServer 5.0 this also applies to PixMap symbols.

    When scaling of symbols is in effect (`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM` is
    specified for the :ref:`LAYER`), `GAP` specifies the distance in
    layer `SIZEUNITS` at the map scale 1:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM`.

    - For lines, the first symbol will be placed `GAP`/2 from the
      start of the line.
    - For lines, a negative `GAP` value will cause the symbols' X axis
      to be aligned relative to the tangent of the line.
    - For lines, a positive `GAP` value aligns the symbols' X axis
      relative to the X axis of the output device.
    - For lines, a `GAP` of 0 (the default value) will cause the symbols
      to be rendered edge to edge
    - For polygons, a missing `GAP` or a `GAP` of 0 will cause the
      symbols to be rendered edge to edge.

    Symbols can be rotated using `ANGLE`.

    .. versionadded:: 6.0 moved from :ref:`SYMBOL`

    .. note::

      The behaviour of `GAP` has not been stable over time.  It has
      specified the amount of space between the symbols, and also
      something in between the amount of space between the symbols and
      the center to center distance.  The goal is to have `GAP`
      specify the center to center distance, but in version 6.0 it is
      the amount of space between the symbols that is specified.

GEOMTRANSFORM [bbox|end|labelpnt|labelpoly|start|vertices]
    Used to indicate that the current feature will be transformed
    before the actual style is applied. Introduced in version 5.4.

    - *bbox*: produces the bounding box of the geometry.
    - *end*: produces the last point of the geometry. When used with
      `ANGLE` AUTO, it can for instance be used to render an arrowhead.
    - *labelpnt*: used for :ref:`LABEL` styles.  It produces a point
      that is placed at the label's reference point.
    - *labelpoly*: used for :ref:`LABEL` styles.  Produces a polygon
      that covers the label plus a 1 pixel padding.
    - *start*: produces the first point of the current geometry. When
      used with `ANGLE` AUTO, it can for instance be used to render
      arrow tail on line segments.
    - *vertices*: produces all the intermediate vertices (points) of
      the underlying geometry (the start and end are excluded). When
      used with `ANGLE` AUTO, the marker is oriented by the half angle
      formed by the two adjacent line segments.

LINECAP [butt|round|square]
    Sets the line cap type for lines. Default is `round`.  See
    :ref:`sym_construction` for explanation and examples.

    .. versionadded:: 6.0 moved from :ref:`SYMBOL`

LINEJOIN [round|miter|bevel]
    Sets the line join type for lines. Default is `round`.  See
    :ref:`sym_construction` for explanation and examples.

    .. versionadded:: 6.0 moved from :ref:`SYMBOL`

LINEJOINMAXSIZE [int]

    Sets the max length of the `miter` `LINEJOIN` type. The value
    represents a coefficient which multiplies a current symbol
    size. Default is 3.  See :ref:`sym_construction` for explanation
    and examples.

    .. versionadded:: 6.0 moved from :ref:`SYMBOL`

MAXSIZE [double]
    Maximum size in pixels to draw a symbol. Default is 500.  Starting
    from version 5.4, the value can also be a decimal value (and not
    only integer).

MAXWIDTH [double]
    Maximum width in pixels to draw the line work. Default is 32.
    Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a decimal value
    (and not only integer).

MINSIZE [double]
    Minimum size in pixels to draw a symbol. Default is 0.  Starting
    from version 5.4, the value can also be a decimal value (and not
    only integer).

MINWIDTH [double]
    Minimum width in pixels to draw the line work. Default is 0.
    Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a decimal value
    (and not only integer).

OFFSET [x][y]
    Geometry offset values in layer `SIZEUNITS`.

    When scaling of symbols is in effect (`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM` is
    specified for the :ref:`LAYER`), `OFFSET` gives offset values in
    layer `SIZEUNITS` at the map scale 1:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM`.

    An `OFFSET` of `20` `40` will shift the geometry 20 `SIZEUNITS` to
    the left and 40 `SIZEUNITS` down before rendering.

    For lines, an `OFFSET` of `n` `-99` will produce a line geometry
    that is shifted `n` SIZEUNITS perpendicular to the original line
    geometry.  A positive `n` shifts the line to the right when seen
    along the direction of the line.  A negative `n` shifts the line
    to the left when seen along the direction of the line.

OPACITY [integer|attribute]
    Opacity to draw the current style (applies to 5.2+, :ref:`AGG`
    only, does not apply to pixmap symbols)

    - [*attribute*]  was introduced in version 5.6, to specify the
      attribute to use for opacity values.

OUTLINECOLOR [r] [g] [b] | [attribute]

    - Color to use for outlining polygons and certain marker symbols
      (ellipse, vector and truetype).  Has no effect for lines.  The
      width of the outline can be specified using `WIDTH`.  If no
      WIDTH is specified, an outline of one pixel will be drawn.  `r`,
      `g` and `b` shall be integers [0..255].  To specify green, the
      following is used:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

         OUTLINECOLOR 0 255 0
         WIDTH 3.0

    - [*attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the
      attribute to use for color values.  The hard brackets [] are
      required.  For example, if your data set has an attribute named
      "MYPAINT" that holds color values for each record, use:
      object for might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

         OUTLINECOLOR [MYPAINT]

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.

PATTERN [double on] [double off] [double on] [double off] ... END

    Currently used to defines a dash pattern for line work (lines,
    polygon outlines, ...).  The numbers (doubles) specify the lengths
    of the dashes and gaps of the dash pattern in layer `SIZEUNITS`.

    When scaling of symbols is in effect (`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM` is
    specified for the :ref:`LAYER`), the numbers specify the lengths
    of the dashes and gaps in layer `SIZEUNITS` at the map scale
    1:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM`.

    To specify a dashed line that is 5 units wide, with dash lengths
    of 5 units and gaps of 5 units, the following style can be used:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        STYLE
          COLOR 0 0 0
          WIDTH 5.0
          LINECAP BUTT
          PATTERN 5.0 5.0 END
        END

    .. versionadded:: 6.0 moved from :ref:`SYMBOL`

SIZE [double|attribute]

    Height, in layer `SIZEUNITS`, of the symbol/pattern to be used.
    Only useful with scalable symbols (:ref:`SYMBOL` `TYPE` ellipse,
    hatch, pixmap, truetype, vector). Default is 1.0.

    When scaling of symbols is in effect (`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM` is
    specified for the :ref:`LAYER`), `SIZE` gives the height, in layer
    `SIZEUNITS`, of the symbol/pattern to be used at the map scale
    1:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM`.

    - For symbols of `TYPE` `hatch`, the `SIZE` is the center to
      center distance between the lines. For its use with hatched
      lines, see Example#8 in the
      :ref:`symbology examples <sym_examples>`.
    - [*attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the
      attribute to use for size values.
      The hard brackets [] are required.
      For example, if your data set has an attribute named "MYHIGHT"
      that holds size values for each feature, your STYLE object for
      hatched lines might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        STYLE
          SYMBOL 'hatch-test'
          COLOR 255 0 0
          ANGLE 45
          SIZE [MYHIGHT]
          WIDTH 3.0
        END

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.
    - Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a decimal
      value (and not only integer).

SIZEITEM [string]
    SIZE [*attribute*] must now be used instead.

    .. deprecated:: 5.0

SYMBOL [integer|string|filename|attribute]
    The symbol name or number to use for all features if attribute
    tables are not used. The number is the index of the symbol in the
    symbol file, starting at 1, the 5th symbol in the file is
    therefore symbol number 5.  You can also give your symbols names
    using the `NAME` keyword in the symbol definition file, and use
    those to refer to them. Default is 0, which results in a single
    pixel, single width line, or solid polygon fill, depending on
    layer type.

    You can also specify a GIF or PNG filename. The path is relative
    to the location of the mapfile.

    [*attribute*] was introduced in version 5.6, to use an attribute
    to specify the symbol name.  The hard brackets [] are required.

WIDTH [double|attribute]

    `WIDTH` refers to the thickness of line work drawn, in layer
    `SIZEUNITS`.  Default is 1.0.

    When scaling of symbols is in effect (`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM` is
    specified for the :ref:`LAYER`), `WIDTH` refers to the thickness
    of the line work in layer `SIZEUNITS` at the map scale
    1:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM`.

    - If used with `SYMBOL` and `OUTLINECOLOR`, `WIDTH` specifies the
      width of the symbol outlines.  This applies to :ref:`SYMBOL`
      `TYPE` `vector` (polygons), `ellipse` and `truetype`.
    - For lines, `WIDTH` specifies the width of the line.
    - For polygons, if used with `OUTLINECOLOR`, `WIDTH` specifies the
      thickness of the polygon outline.
    - For a symbol of :ref:`SYMBOL` `TYPE` `hatch`, `WIDTH`
      specifies the thickness of the hatched lines.
      For its use with hatched lines, see Example #7 in the
      :ref:`symbology examples <sym_examples>`.
    - [*attribute*] was added in version 5.4 to specify the attribute
      to use for the width value. The hard brackets [] are required.
    - Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a decimal
      value (and not only integer).
