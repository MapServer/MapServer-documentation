Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of version 6.0, expressions are used in four places:

* In :ref:`LAYER` `FILTER` to specify the features of the dataset that
  are to be included in the layer.

* In :ref:`CLASS` `EXPRESSION` to specify to which features of the
  dataset the `CLASS` applies to.

* In :ref:`CLASS` `TEXT` to specify text for labeling features.

* In :ref:`STYLE` `GEOMTRANSFORM`.

String quotation
...............................................................................

Stings can be quoted using single or double quotes:

::

   'This is a string'
   "And this is also a string"

.. index::
   single: Quotes escaping

Quotes escaping in strings
...............................................................................

.. note::

    Quotes escaping is not supported in MapServer versions lower than 5.0.

Starting with MapServer 5.0, if your dataset contains double-quotes, you 
can use a C-like escape sequence:

::

    "National \"hero\" statue"

To escape a single quote use the following sequence instead:

::

    "National \'hero\' statue"

Starting with Mapserver 6.0 you don't need to escape single quotes
within double qouted strings and you don't need to escape double
quotes within single quoted strings.  In 6.0 you can also write
the string as follows:

::

    'National "hero" statue'
    ...

To escape a single quote use the following sequence instead:

::

    "National 'hero' statue"


.. index::
   pair: Expressions; Attributes

Using attributes
...............................................................................

Attribute values can be referenced in the Map file and used in
expressions. Attribute references are case sensitive and can
be used in the following types of expressions:

* In :ref:`LAYER` `FILTER`

* In :ref:`CLASS` `EXPRESSION`

* In :ref:`CLASS` `TEXT`

Referencing an attribute is done by enclosing the attribute name in
square brackets, like this: [ATTRIBUTENAME].  Then, every occurrence
of "[ATTRIBUTENAME]" will be replaced by the actual value of the
attribute "ATTRIBUTENAME".

Example: The data set of our layer has the attribute "BUILDING_NAME".
We want the value of this attribute to appear inside a string.  This
can be accomplished as follows (single or double qoutes):

::

    'The [BUILDING_NAME] building'

For the building which has its BUILDING_NAME attribute set to
"Historical Museum", the resulting string is:

::

    'The Historical Museum building'

For :ref:`RASTER` layers special attributes have been defined that can
be used for classification, for example:

* [PIXEL]
  ... will become the pixel value as number
* [RED], [GREEN], [BLUE]
  ... will become the color value for the red, green and blue
  component in the pixel value, respectively.



.. index::
   single: Expression types

Expression Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expression are used to match attribute values with certain logical
checks.  There are three different types of expressions you can use
with MapServer:

* String comparisons: A single attribute is compared with a string
  value.

* Regular expressions: A single attribute is matched with a regular
  expression.

* Logical "MapServer expressions": One or more attributes are compared
  using logical expressions.

.. index::
   pair: Expressions; String comparison

String comparison (equality)
...............................................................................

String comparison means, as the name suggests, that attribute values
are checked if they are equal to some value. String comparisons are
the simplest form of MapServer expressions and the fastest option.

.. index::
    pair: EXPRESSION; CLASSITEM
    
To use a string comparison for filtering a :ref:`LAYER`, both
`FILTERITEM` and `FILTER` must be set.  `FILTERITEM` is set to the
attribute name.  `FILTER` is set to the value for comparison. The same
rule applies to :ref:`CLASSITEM <classitem>` in the :ref:`LAYER`
object and `EXPRESSION` in the :ref:`CLASS` object.

Example for a simple string comparison filter

::

    FILTER "2005"
    FILTERITEM "year"

would match all records that have the attribute "year" set to "2005".
The rendered map would appear as if the dataset would only contain
those items that have the "year" set to "2005".

Similarly, a classification for the items matched above would be done
by setting the `CLASSITEM` in the :ref:`LAYER` and the `EXPRESSION` in
the :ref:`CLASS`:

::

    LAYER
        NAME "example"
        CLASSITEM "year"
        ...
        CLASS
            NAME "year-2005"
            EXPRESSION "2005"
            ...
        END
    END

For reasons explained later, the values for both `CLASSITEM` and
`FILTERITEM` should start with neither a '/' nor a '(' character.

.. index:: Regular expressions

.. index::
   pair: Expressions; Regular expression comparison

Regular expression comparison
...............................................................................

Regular expressions are a standard text pattern matching mechanism
from the Unix world.  The functionality of regular expression matching
is provided by the operating system on UNIX systems and therefore
slightly operating system dependent.  However, their minimum set of
features are those defined by the POSIX standard.  The documentation
of the particular regular expression library is usually in the "regex"
manual page ("man regex") on Unix systems.

Regular expression with MapServer work similarly to string comparison,
but allow more complex operation.  They are slower than pure string
comparisons, but might be still faster than logical expression.  As
for string comparison, when using a regular expressions, `FILTERITEM`
(:ref:`LAYER` `FILTER`) or `CLASSITEM` (:ref:`CLASS` `EXPRESSION`) has
to be defined if the items are not included in the :ref:`LAYER`
`FILTER` or :ref:`CLASS` `EXPRESSION`.

A regular expression typically consists of characters with special
meanings and characters that are interpreted as they are.
Alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z and 0-9) are taken as they are.
Characters with special meanings are:

* **.** will match a single character.

* **[** and **]** are used for grouping. For example *[A-Z]* would
  match the characters A,B,C,...,X,Y,Z.

* **{**, **}**, and **\*** are used to specify how often something
  should match.

* **^** matches the beginning, **$** matches the end of the value.

* The backslash **\\** is used to take away the special meaning.  For
  example *\\$* would match the dollar sign.

Mapserver supports two regex operators:

* **~** case insensitive regular expression

* **~\*** case sensitive regular expression

The following :ref:`LAYER` configuration would have all records
rendered on the map that have "hotel" in the attribute named
"placename"

::

    LAYER
        NAME 'regexp-example'
        FILTERITEM 'placename'
        FILTER /hotel/
        ...
    END

.. note:: 

    For `FILTER`, the regular expression is case-sensitive, thus
    records having "Hotel" in them would not have matched.

Example: Match records that have a value from 2000 to 2010 in the
attribute "year":

::

    FILTERITEM "year"
    FILTER /^20[0-9][0-9]/

Example: Match all the records that are either purely numerical or
empty

::

    FILTER /^[0-9]*$/

Example: Match all the features where the *name* attribute ends with
"by", "BY", "By" or "bY" (case insensitive matching):

::

    EXPRESSION ('[name]' ~* 'by$')

.. note:: 
    
    If you experience frequently segmentation faults when working with
    MapServer and regular expressions, it might be that your current
    working environment is linked against more than one regular
    expression library. This can happen when MapServer is linked with
    components that bring their own copy, like the Apache httpd or
    PHP. In these cases the author has made best experiences with
    making all those components using the regular expression library
    of the operating system (i.e. the one in libc). That involved
    editing the build files of some of the components, however.

"MapServer expressions"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MapServer expressions are the most complex and depending how they are
written can become quite slow. They can match any of the attributes
and thus allow filtering and classification depending on more than one
attribute.  Besides pure logical operations there are also expressions
that allow certain arithmetic, string and time operations.

To be able to use a MapServer expression for a FILTER or EXPRESSION
value, the expression has to finally become a logical value.

.. index::
   pair: Expressions; Logical expressions

Logical expressions
...............................................................................

Syntactically, a logical expression is everything encapsulated in
round brackets.  Logical expressions take logical values as their
input and return logical values. A logical expression is either 'true'
or 'false'.

* ( ( Expression1 ) AND ( Expression2 ) )

  ( ( Expression1 ) && ( Expression2 ) )

  returns true when both of the logical expressions (Expression1 and
  Expression2) are true.


* ( ( Expression1 ) OR ( Expression2 ) )

  ( ( Expression1 ) || ( Expression2 ) )

  returns true when at least one of the logical expressions (Expression1
  or Expression2) is true.

* NOT ( Expression1 )

  ! ( Expression1 )

  returns true when Expression1 is false.
   
.. index::
   pair: Expressions; String expressions

String expressions that return a logical value
...............................................................................

Syntactically, a sting is something encapsulated in single or double
quotes.

*  ( "String1" eq "String2" )

   ( "String1" == "String2" ) - deprecated since 6.0

   ( "String1" = "String2" )

   returns true when the strings are equal.  Case sensitive.

*  ( "String1" =\* "String2" )

   returns true when the strings are equal.  Case insensitive.

*  ( "String1" != "String2" )

   ( "String1" ne "String2" )

   returns true when the strings are not equal.

*  ( "String1" < "String2" )

   ( "String1" lt "String2" )

   returns true when "String1" is lexicographically smaller than "String2"

*  ( "String1" > "String2" )

   ( "String1" gt "String2" )

   returns true when "String1" is lexicographically larger than "String2".

*  ( "String1" <= "String2" )

   ( "String1" le "String2" )

   returns true when "String1" is lexicographically smaller than or equal
   to "String2"

*  ( "String1" >= "String2" )

   ( "String1" ge "String2" )

   returns true when "String1" is lexicographically larger than or equal
   to "String2".

*  ( "String1" IN "token1,token2,...,tokenN" )

   returns true when "String1" is equal to one of the given tokens.

   .. note:: 

      The separator for the tokens is the comma. That means that there
      can not be unnecessary white space in the list and that tokens
      that have commas in them cannot be compared.

*  ( "String1" ~ "regexp" )

   returns true when "String1" matches the regular expression
   "regexp". This operation is identical to the regular expression
   matching described earlier.

*  ( "String1" ~* "regexp" )

   returns true when "String1" matches the regular expression "regexp"
   (case insensitive). This operation is identical to the regular
   expression matching described earlier.

String operations that return a string
...............................................................................

*  "String1" + "String2'

   returns "String1String2", that is, the two strings concatenated
   to each other.


Functions that return a string
...............................................................................

   uses "Format1" to format the number n1 (C style formatting
   - sprintf).

   adds thousands separators (commas) to a long number to make it
   more readable

...............................................................................

*  round ( n1 , n2 )

   returns n1 rounded to a multiple of n2: n2 * round(n1/n2)

*  n1 + n2

   returns the sum of n1 and n2

.. note::

    When the numerical operations above are used like logical
    operations, the following rule applies: values equal to zero will
    be taken as 'false' and everything else will be 'true'.  That
    means the expression

    ::

      ( 6 + 5 )

    would return true, but 

    ::

      ( 5 - 5 )

    would return false.

Temporal expressions
...............................................................................

MapServer uses an internal time type to do comparison. To convert a
string into this time type it will check the list below from the top
and down to check if the specified time matches, and if so, it will do
the conversion.  The following are integer values: **YYYY** - year,
**MM** - month, **DD** - date, **hh** - hours, **mm** - minutes,
**ss** - seconds.  The following are character elements of the format:
**-** (dash) - date separator, **:** (colon) - time separator, **T** -
marks the start of the time component (ISO 8601), space - marks the
end of the date and start of the time component, **Z** - zulu time (0
UTC offset).

* YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
* YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
* YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
* YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm
* YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm
* YYYY-MM-DDThh
* YYYY-MM-DD hh
* YYYY-MM-DD
* YYYY-MM
* YYYY
* Thh:mm:ssZ
* Thh:mm:ss

For temporal values obtained this way, the following operations are
supported:

*  ( t1 eq t2 )

   ( t1 == t2 ) - deprecated since 6.0

   ( t1 = t2 )

   returns true when the times are equal.

*  ( t1 != t2 )

   ( t1 ne t2 )

   returns true when the times are not equal.

*  ( t1 < t2 )

   ( t1 lt t2 )

   returns true when t1 is earlier than t2

*  ( t1 > t2 )

   ( t1 gt t2 )

   returns true when t1 is later than t2.

*  ( t1 <= t2 )

   ( t1 le t2 )

   returns true when t1 is earlier than or equal to t2

*  ( t1 >= t2 )

   ( t1 ge t2 )

   returns true when t1 is later than or equal to t2.
