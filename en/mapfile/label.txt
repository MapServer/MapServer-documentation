   pair: LABEL; ALIGN
   :name: mapfile-label-align

ALIGN [left|center|right|attribute]
    .. versionadded:: 5.4

    Specifies text alignment for multiline labels (see WRAP_) Note
    that the alignment algorithm is far from precise, so don't expect
    fabulous results (especially for *right* alignment) if you're not
    using a fixed width font.

    [attribute] was added in version 7.6. If an attribute is used,
    it is expected to be:

    * of type *string* and should be one of the following: *left*, *center*, *right*.

    * of type *integer* and should be [1,2,3] which means:

      * 1 = "left"
      * 2 = "center"
      * 3 = "right"

    if the [attribute] is of type *integer* as described above, the label
    generation will be much faster, since string comparison is avoided.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; ANGLE
   :name: mapfile-label-angle

ANGLE [double|auto|auto2|follow|attribute]
    - Angle, counterclockwise, given in degrees, to draw the label.
      Default is 0.
    - AUTO allows MapServer to compute the angle. Valid for LINE
      layers only.
    - AUTO2 same as AUTO, except no logic is applied to try to keep
      the text from being rendered in reading orientation (i.e. the
      text may be rendered upside down). Useful when adding text
      arrows indicating the line direction.
    - FOLLOW was introduced in version 4.10 and tells MapServer to
      compute a curved label for appropriate linear features (see
      :ref:`RFC11` for specifics).  See also `MAXOVERLAPANGLE`.
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for angle values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYANGLE" that holds angle values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  150 150 150
          OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255
          FONT "sans"
          TYPE truetype
          SIZE 6
          ANGLE [MYANGLE]
          POSITION AUTO
          PARTIALS FALSE
        END

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; ANTIALIAS
   :name: mapfile-label-antialias

ANTIALIAS [true|false]
    Should text be antialiased? Note that this requires more available
    colors, decreases drawing performance, and results in slightly
    larger output images.  Only useful for GD (gif) rendering.
    Default is false.  Has no effect for the other renderers (where
    anti-aliasing can not be turned off).

BACKGROUNDCOLOR [r] [g] [b] | [hexadecimal string]
    .. versionremoved:: 6.0  
       Use a `LABEL STYLE`_ object with`GEOMTRANSFORM labelpoly` and `COLOR`
       instead.
       
    Color to draw a background rectangle (i.e. billboard). Off by default.

BACKGROUNDSHADOWCOLOR [r] [g] [b] | [hexadecimal string]
    .. versionremoved:: 6.0  
       Use a `LABEL STYLE`_ object with `GEOMTRANSFORM labelpoly`, 
       `COLOR` and `OFFSET` instead.
       
    Color to draw a background rectangle (i.e. billboard) shadow. Off by
    default.

BACKGROUNDSHADOWSIZE [x][y]
    .. versionremoved:: 6.0 
       Use a `LABEL STYLE`_ object with `GEOMTRANSFORM labelpoly`, 
       `COLOR` and `OFFSET` instead.
       
    How far should the background rectangle be offset? Default is 1.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; BUFFER
   :name: mapfile-label-buffer

BUFFER [integer]

    text to enhance readability. Available only for cached labels.
    Default is 0.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; COLOR
   :name: mapfile-label-color

COLOR [r] [g] [b] | [hexadecimal string] | [attribute]
    - Color to draw text with.

    - `r`, `g` and `b` shall be integers [0..255].  To specify green,
      the following is used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           COLOR 0 255 0

    - `hexadecimal string` can be

      - RGB value: "#rrggbb".  To specify magenta, the following is
        used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           COLOR "#FF00FF"

      - RGBA value (adding translucence): "#rrggbbaa".  To specify a
        semi-translucent magenta, the following is used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           COLOR "#FF00FFCC"

    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for color values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYCOLOR" that holds color values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  [MYCOLOR]
          OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; ENCODING
   :name: mapfile-label-encoding

ENCODING [string]
    .. versionremoved:: 7.0
       UTF-8 is now the encoding used by MapServer, and
       dataset encodings are handled using :ref:`LAYER` `ENCODING`
       instead.
         
    Supported encoding format to be used for labels.  If the format is
    not supported, the label will not be drawn.  Requires the iconv
    library (present on most systems).  The library is always detected
    if present on the system, but if not, the label will not be drawn.

    Required for displaying international characters in MapServer.
    More information can be found in the :ref:`Label Encoding document
    <encoding>`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; EXPRESSION
   :name: mapfile-label-expression

    Expression that determines when the `LABEL` is to be applied.
    See `EXPRESSION` in :ref:`CLASS`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; FONT
   :name: mapfile-label-font

FONT [name|attribute]
    - Font alias (as defined in the FONTSET) to use for labeling.
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.6 to specify the font
      alias.
    - May contain a comma-separated list of up to MS_MAX_LABEL_FONTS
      (usually 5) font aliases used as fallback fonts in renderers
      supporting it, if a glyph is not available in a font. If specified
      directly, be sure to enclose the list with quotes. See :ref:`RFC80`.
    - Since version 7, MapServer supports language specific fonts.
      See :ref:`RFC98`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; FORCE
   :name: mapfile-label-force

.. _FORCE:

FORCE [true|false|group]
    Forces labels for a particular class on, regardless of collisions.
    Available only for cached labels.  Default is false.  If `FORCE`
    is true and `PARTIALS` is false, `FORCE` takes precedence, and
    partial labels are drawn.
    
    The GROUP parameter, added in version 6.2, determines if the label 
    is allowed to intersect other labels from the same feature. Multiple STYLE blocks 
    can be used to render graphic symbols instead of 
    or alongside text. See :ref:`announce-6-2-force-group`. 

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXLENGTH
   :name: mapfile-label-maxlength

.. _MAXLENGTH:

MAXLENGTH [integer]
    .. versionadded:: 5.4

    This keyword interacts with the WRAP_ keyword so that line breaks
    only occur after the defined number of characters.

    .. csv-table:: Interaction with WRAP_ keyword

        "", **maxlength = 0** ,  **maxlength > 0**
        **wrap = ‘char’** ,always wrap at the WRAP_ character ,newline at the first WRAP_ character after MAXLENGTH_ characters
        **no wrap** ,no processing,skip label if it contains more than MAXLENGTH_ characters

    The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC40`.

    Support for negative MAXLENGTH that implied forced linebreaks is not
    supported since version 7, a workaround implies pre-processing such labels
    to include linebreaks or wrap characters.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXOVERLAPANGLE
   :name: mapfile-label-maxoverlapangle

MAXOVERLAPANGLE [double]
    Angle threshold to use in filtering out ANGLE FOLLOW labels in
    which characters overlap (floating point value in degrees). This
    filtering will be enabled by default starting with MapServer
    6.0. The default MAXOVERLAPANGLE value will be 22.5 degrees, which
    also matches the default in GeoServer. Users will be free to tune
    the value up or down depending on the type of data they are
    dealing with and their tolerance to bad overlap in labels.
    As per RFC 60, if MAXOVERLAPANGLE is set to 0, then we fall back
    on pre-6.0 behavior which was to use maxoverlapangle = 0.4*MS_PI
    (40% of 180 degrees = 72degree).

    The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC60`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXSCALEDENOM
   :name: mapfile-label-maxscaledenom

MAXSCALEDENOM [double]
    .. versionadded:: 5.4

    Minimum scale at which this :ref:`LABEL` is drawn. Scale is given
    as the denominator of the actual scale fraction, for example for a
    map at a scale of 1:24,000 use 24000.

    .. seealso::

        :term:`Map Scale`

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXSIZE
   :name: mapfile-label-maxsize

MAXSIZE [double]
    Maximum font size to use when scaling text (pixels). Default is 256.
    Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a fractional value
    (and not only integer).
    See :ref:`LAYER` :ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM <symbolscaledenom>`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MINDISTANCE
   :name: mapfile-label-mindistance

MINDISTANCE [integer]
    Minimum distance between duplicate labels. Given in pixels.
    Starting from version 7.2, the distance is calculated from the
    label boundary. Prior versions used the label center.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MINFEATURESIZE
   :name: mapfile-label-minfeaturesize

MINFEATURESIZE [integer|auto]
    Minimum size a feature must be to be labeled. Given in pixels. For
    line data the overall length of the displayed line is used, for
    polygons features the smallest dimension of the bounding box is
    used. "Auto" keyword tells MapServer to only label features that
    are larger than their corresponding label. Available for cached
    labels only.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MINSCALEDENOM
   :name: mapfile-label-minscaledenom

MINSCALEDENOM [double]
    .. versionadded:: 5.4

    Maximum scale at which this :ref:`LABEL` is drawn. Scale is given
    as the denominator of the actual scale fraction, for example for a
    map at a scale of 1:24,000 use 24000.

   :name: mapfile-label-minsize

MINSIZE [double]
    Minimum font size to use when scaling text (pixels). Default is 4.
    Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a fractional value
    (and not only integer).
    See :ref:`LAYER` :ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM <symbolscaledenom>`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OFFSET
   :name: mapfile-label-offset

OFFSET [x|attribute_x][y|attribute_y]
    Offset values for labels, relative to the lower left hand corner of the
    label and the label point. Given in pixels. In the case of rotated text
    specify the values as if all labels are horizontal and any rotation will
    be compensated for.

    [attribute_x] and [attribute_y] were added in version 7.6. If an attribute
    is used, it must be of type *integer*.

    When used with FOLLOW angle, two additional options are available to
    render the label parallel to the original feature:

    - OFFSET x -99 : will render the label to the left or to the right of the
      feature, depending on the sign of {x}.
    - OFFSET x 99 : will render the label above or below the feature,
      depending on the sign of {x}.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OUTLINECOLOR
   :name: mapfile-label-outlinecolor

.. _OUTLINECOLOR:

OUTLINECOLOR [r] [g] [b] | [hexadecimal string] | [attribute]
    - Color to draw a one pixel outline around the characters in the text.

    - `r`, `g` and `b` shall be integers [0..255].  To specify green,
      the following is used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           OUTLINECOLOR 0 255 0

    - `hexadecimal string` can be

      - RGB value: "#rrggbb".  To specify magenta, the following is
        used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           OUTLINECOLOR "#FF00FF"

      - RGBA value (adding translucence): "#rrggbbaa".  To specify a
        semi-translucent magenta, the following is used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           OUTLINECOLOR "#FF00FFCC"

    - [*attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for color values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYOUTCOLOR" that holds color values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  150 150 150
          OUTLINECOLOR [MYOUTCOLOR]

        END

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OUTLINEWIDTH
   :name: mapfile-label-outlinewidth

.. _OUTLINEWIDTH:

OUTLINEWIDTH [integer]
    Width of the outline if OUTLINECOLOR_ has been set. Defaults to 1.
    Currently only the AGG renderer supports values greater than 1, and
    renders these as a 'halo' effect: recommended values are 3 or 5. If the
    renderer supports it and the text size is variable, the outline will be
    scaled proportionally to the text and the value specified as
    OUTLINEWIDTH is therefore the width at the same scale at which the
    SIZE_ is specified.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; PARTIALS
   :name: mapfile-label-partials

PARTIALS [true|false]
    Can text run off the edge of the map? Default is false.  If `FORCE`
    is true and `PARTIALS` is false, `FORCE` takes precedence, and
    partial labels are drawn.
    
    .. note::
       The default changed from true to false, since the MapServer 7.2
       release.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; POSITION
   :name: mapfile-label-position

POSITION [ul|uc|ur|cl|cc|cr|ll|lc|lr|auto|attribute]
    Position of the label relative to the labeling point (layers
    only). First letter is "Y" position, second letter is "X"
    position. "Auto" tells MapServer to calculate a label position
    that will not interfere with other labels. With points, MapServer
    selects from the 8 outer positions (i.e. excluding cc). With
    polygons, MapServer selects from cc (added in MapServer 5.4), uc,
    lc, cl and cr as possible positions.  With lines, it only uses lc
    or uc, until it finds a position that doesn't collide with labels
    that have already been drawn. If all positions cause a conflict,
    then the label is not drawn (Unless the label's FORCE_ a parameter
    is set to "true"). "Auto" placement is only available with cached
    labels.

    When used with attribute, it must be of type *string* and use one
    of the following: *ul|uc|ur|cl|cc|cr|ll|lc|lr|auto*.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; PRIORITY
   :name: mapfile-label-priority

PRIORITY [integer]|[item_name]|[attribute]
    .. versionadded:: 5.0

    The priority parameter takes an integer value between 1 (lowest)
    and 10 (highest). The default value is 1. It is also possible to
    bind the priority to an attribute (item_name) using square
    brackets around the [item_name]. e.g. "PRIORITY [someattribute]"

    Labels are stored in the label cache and rendered in order of
    priority, with the highest priority levels rendered first.
    Specifying an out of range PRIORITY value inside a map file will
    result in a parsing error. An out of range value set via
    MapScript or coming from a shape attribute will be clamped to the
    min/max values at rendering time.  There is no expected impact on
    performance for using label priorities.

    [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.6.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; REPEATDISTANCE
   :name: mapfile-label-repeatdistance

REPEATDISTANCE [integer]
    .. versionadded:: 5.6

    The label will be repeated on every line of a multiline shape and
    will be repeated multiple times along a given line at an interval
    of REPEATDISTANCE pixels.

    The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC57`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SHADOWCOLOR
   :name: mapfile-label-shadowcolor

SHADOWCOLOR [r] [g] [b] | [hexadecimal string]
    Color of drop shadow. A label with the same text will be rendered
    in this color before the main label is drawn, resulting in a
    shadow effect on the the label characters. The offset of the
    renderered shadow is set with SHADOWSIZE.

    - `r`, `g` and `b` shall be integers [0..255].  To specify green,
      the following is used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           SHADOWCOLOR 0 255 0

    - `hexadecimal string` can be

      - RGB value: "#rrggbb".  To specify magenta, the following is
        used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           SHADOWCOLOR "#FF00FF"

      - RGBA value (adding translucence): "#rrggbbaa".  To specify a
        semi-translucent magenta, the following is used:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

           SHADOWCOLOR "#FF00FFCC"

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SHADOWSIZE
   :name: mapfile-label-shadowsize

SHADOWSIZE [x][y]|[attribute][attribute]|[x][attribute]|[attribute][y]
    Shadow offset in pixels, see SHADOWCOLOR.

    [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 6.0, and can be used like:

    .. code-block:: mapfile

        SHADOWSIZE 2 2
        SHADOWSIZE [shadowsizeX] 2
        SHADOWSIZE 2 [shadowsizeY]
        SHADOWSIZE [shadowsize] [shadowsize]


.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SIZE
   :name: mapfile-label-size

.. _SIZE:

SIZE [integer]|[tiny|small|medium|large|giant]|[attribute]|[expression]
    - Text size. Use a number to give the size in pixels of your
      TrueType font based label, or any of the other 5 listed keywords
      for bitmap fonts.

      When scaling is in effect (:ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM
      <symbolscaledenom>` is specified for the :ref:`LAYER`), `SIZE`
      gives the size of the font to be used at the map scale
      1:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM`.
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for size values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYSIZE" that holds size values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  150 150 150
          OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255
          FONT "sans"
          TYPE truetype
          SIZE [MYSIZE]
          POSITION AUTO
          PARTIALS FALSE
        END

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.

    - [expression] was added in version 7.6 to allow arithmetic expressions
      returning an integer value as part of :ref:`RFC124`. Attributes can be used
      as part of this expression:
   
      .. code-block:: mapfile
   
        LABEL
          TEXT "[name]"
          COLOR 255 255 255
          TYPE TRUETYPE
          FONT vera-bold
          SIZE (( [s12] * [s12] ) - 132 )
        END
    
    .. note::
         The SIZE value can only be an integer (not a fractional
         value), because the renderer Freetype only accepts integers.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; STYLE
   :name: mapfile-label-style

.. _`LABEL STYLE`:

:ref:`STYLE`
    The start of a :ref:`STYLE` object.

    Label specific mechanisms of the :ref:`STYLE` object are the
    GEOMTRANSFORM options:

    GEOMTRANSFORM [labelcenter|labelpnt|labelpoly]
      .. versionadded:: 6.0
    
      Creates a geometry that can be used for styling the label. Does not
      apply to ANGLE FOLLOW labels.

      - labelcenter places the text in the center of the feature.

      - labelpnt draws a marker on the geographic position the label is
        attached to. This corresponds to the center of the label text
        only if the label is in position CC.

      - labelpoly generates the bounding rectangle for the text, with
        1 pixel of padding added in all directions.

      The resulting geometries can be styled using the mechanisms
      available in the `STYLE` object.

        Example - draw a red background rectangle for the labels
        with a "shadow" (i.e. billboard) in gray text, centered in 
        the polygon feature:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

          STYLE
            GEOMTRANSFORM 'labelcenter'
            COLOR 153 153 153
          END # STYLE
          STYLE
            GEOMTRANSFORM 'labelpoly'
            COLOR 255 0 0
          END # STYLE

TYPE [bitmap|truetype]
    Type of font to use. Generally bitmap fonts are faster to draw
    then TrueType fonts. However, TrueType fonts are scalable and
    available in a variety of faces. Be sure to set the FONT parameter
    if you select TrueType.

    .. note::
         Bitmap fonts are only supported with the AGG and GD
         renderers.

.. _WRAP:

WRAP [character]
    Character that represents an end-of-line condition in label text,
    thus resulting in a multi-line label. Interacts with MAXLENGTH_
    for conditional line wrapping after a given number of characters.

    Labels are also wrapped at Zero Width Space Unicode characters (0x200b) when WRAP_ is enabled. For example, allow wrapping after hyphens without removing the hyphen character at the wrap. You can insert this character in your PostGIS query with `replace(field, '-', E'-\u200b')`.
