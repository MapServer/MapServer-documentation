ALIGN [left|center|right]
    Specifies text alignment for multiline labels (see WRAP_) Note
    that the alignment algorithm is far from precise, so don't expect
    fabulous results (especially for *right* alignment) if you're not
    using a fixed width font.

   pair: LABEL; ANGLE

ANGLE [double|auto|follow|attribute]
    - Angle, given in degrees, to draw the label.  
    - AUTO allows MapServer to compute the angle. Valid for LINE
      layers only.
    - FOLLOW was introduced in version 4.10 and tells MapServer to
      compute a curved label for appropriate linear features (see
      :ref:`RFC11` for specifics).
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for angle values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYANGLE" that holds angle values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; ANTIALIAS

ANTIALIAS [true|false]
    Should text be antialiased? Note that this requires more available
    colors, decreases drawing performance, and results in slightly
    larger output images.  Only useful for GD (gif) rendering.
    Default is false.  Has no effect for the other renderers (where
    anti-aliasing can not be turned off).

BACKGROUNDCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to draw a background rectangle (i.e. billboard). Off by default.

    .. note::
       Removed in 6.0.  Use a `LABEL STYLE`_ object with
       `GEOMTRANSFORM labelpoly` and `COLOR`.

BACKGROUNDSHADOWCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to draw a background rectangle (i.e. billboard) shadow. Off by 
    default.

    .. note::
       Removed in 6.0.  Use a `LABEL STYLE`_ object with
       `GEOMTRANSFORM labelpoly`, `COLOR` and `OFFSET`.

BACKGROUNDSHADOWSIZE [x][y]
    How far should the background rectangle be offset? Default is 1.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; ENCODING

ENCODING [string]
    Supported encoding format to be used for labels. If the format is not 
    supported, the label will not be drawn. Requires the iconv library 
    (present on most systems). The library is always detected if present on 
    the system, but if not the label will not be drawn.

    Required for displaying international characters in
    MapServer. More information can be found in the :ref:`Label
    Encoding document <labelencoding>`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; FONT

FONT [name|attribute]
    - Font alias (as defined in the FONTSET) to use for labeling.
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.6 to specfify the font
      alias.
    - May contain a comma-separated list of up to MS_MAX_LABEL_FONTS
      (usually 5) font aliases used as fallback fonts in renderers 
      supporting it, if a glyph is not available in a font. If specified
      directly, be sure to enclose the list with quotes. See :ref:`RFC80`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; FORCE

.. _FORCE:

FORCE [true|false]
    Forces labels for a particular class on, regardless of collisions.
    Available only for cached labels.  Default is false.  If `FORCE`
    is true and `PARTIALS` is false, `FORCE` takes precedence, and
    partial labels are drawn.

.. index::

    .. versionadded:: 5.4

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXOVERLAPANGLE

MAXOVERLAPANGLE [double]
    Angle threshold to use in filtering out ANGLE FOLLOW labels in
    which characters overlap (floating point value in degrees). This
    filtering will be enabled by default starting with MapServer
    6.0. The default MAXOVERLAPANGLE value will be 22.5 degrees, which
    also matches the default in GeoServer. Users will be free to tune
    the value up or down depending on the type of data they are
    dealing with and their tolerance to bad overlap in labels.
    As per RFC 60, if MAXOVERLAPANGLE is set to 0, then we fall back
    on pre-6.0 behavior which was to use maxoverlapangle = 0.4*MS_PI
    (40% of 180 degrees = 72degree).

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXSIZE

MAXSIZE [double]
    Maximum font size to use when scaling text (pixels). Default is 256.
    Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a fractional value 
    (and not only integer).
    See :ref:`LAYER` :ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM <symbolscaledenom>`.   

.. index::

MINDISTANCE [integer]
    Minimum distance between duplicate labels. Given in pixels.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MINFEATURESIZE

MINFEATURESIZE [integer|auto]
    Minimum size a feature must be to be labeled. Given in pixels. For
    line data the overall length of the displayed line is used, for
    polygons features the smallest dimension of the bounding box is
    used. "Auto" keyword tells MapServer to only label features that
    are larger than their corresponding label. Available for cached
    labels only.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MINSIZE

MINSIZE [double]
    Minimum font size to use when scaling text (pixels). Default is 4.
    Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a fractional value 
    (and not only integer).     
    See :ref:`LAYER` :ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM <symbolscaledenom>`.   

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OFFSET

OFFSET [x][y]
    Offset values for labels, relative to the lower left hand corner of the 
    label and the label point. Given in pixels. In the case of rotated text 
    specify the values as if all labels are horizontal and any rotation will 
    be compensated for.
    See :ref:`LAYER` :ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM <symbolscaledenom>`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OUTLINECOLOR

.. _OUTLINECOLOR:

OUTLINECOLOR [r] [g] [b] | [attribute]
    - Color to draw a one pixel outline around the characters in the text.
    - [*attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for color values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYOUTCOLOR" that holds color values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  150 150 150
          OUTLINECOLOR [MYOUTCOLOR]

        END 

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OUTLINEWIDTH

OUTLINEWIDTH [integer]
    Width of the outline if OUTLINECOLOR_ has been set. Defaults to 1. 
    Currently only the AGG renderer supports values greater than 1, and
    renders these as a 'halo' effect: recommended values are 3 or 5.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; PARTIALS

PARTIALS [true|false]
    Can text run off the edge of the map? Default is true.  If `FORCE`
    is true and `PARTIALS` is false, `FORCE` takes precedence, and
    partial labels are drawn.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; POSITION

POSITION [ul|uc|ur|cl|cc|cr|ll|lc|lr|auto]
    Position of the label relative to the labeling point (layers
    only). First letter is "Y" position, second letter is "X"
    position. "Auto" tells MapServer to calculate a label position
    that will not interfere with other labels. With points, MapServer
    selects from the 8 outer positions (i.e. excluding cc). With
    polygons, MapServer selects from cc (added in MapServer 5.4), uc,
    lc, cl and cr as possible positions.  With lines, it only uses lc
    or uc, until it finds a position that doesn't collide with labels
    that have already been drawn. If all positions cause a conflict,
    then the label is not drawn (Unless the label's FORCE_ a parameter
    is set to "true"). "Auto" placement is only available with cached
    labels.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; PRIORITY

PRIORITY [integer]|[item_name]|[attribute]
    The priority parameter takes an integer value between 1 (lowest)
    and 10 (highest). The default value is 1. It is also possible to
    bind the priority to an attribute (item_name) using square
    brackets around the [item_name]. e.g. "PRIORITY [someattribute]"

    Labels are stored in the label cache and rendered in order of
    priority, with the highest priority levels rendered first.
    Specifying an out of range PRIORITY value inside a map file will
    result in a parsing error. An out of range value set via
    MapScript or coming from a shape attribute will be clamped to the
    min/max values at rendering time.  There is no expected impact on
    performance for using label priorities.

    [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.6.

    .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; REPEATDISTANCE

REPEATDISTANCE [integer] 
    The label will be repeated on every line of a multiline shape and
    will be repeated multiple times along a given line at an interval
    of REPEATDISTANCE pixels.

    The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC57`.

    .. versionadded:: 5.6

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SHADOWCOLOR

SHADOWCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color of drop shadow. A label with the same text will be rendered
    in this color before the main label is drawn, resulting in a
    shadow effect on the the label characters. The offset of the
    renderered shadow is set with SHADOWSIZE.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SHADOWSIZE

SHADOWSIZE [x][y]|[attribute][attribute]|[x][attribute]|[attribute][y]
    Shadow offset in pixels, see SHADOWCOLOR.

    [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 6.0, and can be used like:

    .. code-block:: mapfile

        SHADOWSIZE 2 2
        SHADOWSIZE [shadowsizeX] 2
        SHADOWSIZE 2 [shadowsizeY]
        SHADOWSIZE [shadowsize] [shadowsize]


.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SIZE

SIZE [double]|[tiny|small|medium|large|giant]|[attribute]
    - Text size. Use a number to give the size in pixels of your
      TrueType font based label, or any of the other 5 listed keywords
      for bitmap fonts.

      When scaling is in effect (:ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM
      <symbolscaledenom>` is specified for the :ref:`LAYER`), `SIZE`
      gives the size of the font to be used at the map scale
      1:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM`.
    - Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a fractional
      value (and not only integer).
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for size values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYSIZE" that holds size values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  150 150 150
          OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255     
          FONT "sans"
          TYPE truetype
          SIZE [MYSIZE]
          POSITION AUTO

.. _`LABEL STYLE`:

:ref:`STYLE`
    The start of a :ref:`STYLE` object.

    Label specific mechanisms of the :ref:`STYLE` object are the
    GEOMTRANSFORM options:

    GEOMTRANSFORM [labelpnt|labelpoly]
      Creates a geometry that can be used for styling the label.

      - labelpnt draws a marker on the geographic position the label is
        attached to. This corresponds to the center of the label text 
        only if the label is in position CC. 

      - labelpoly generates the bounding rectangle for the text, with
        1 pixel of padding added in all directions.

      The resulting geometries can be styled using the mechanisms
      available in the `STYLE` object.

        Example - draw a red background rectangle for the labels
        (i.e. billboard) with a "shadow" in gray:

        .. code-block:: mapfile
 
          STYLE
            GEOMTRANSFORM 'labelpoly'
            COLOR 153 153 153
            OFFSET 3 2
          END # STYLE
          STYLE
