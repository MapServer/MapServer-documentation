   pair: LABEL; ALIGN

ALIGN [left|center|right]
    Since version 5.4 . Specifies text alignment for multiline labels
    (see WRAP_) Note that the alignment algorithm is far from precise,
    so don't expect fabulous results (especially for *right*
    alignment) if you're not using a fixed width font.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; ANGLE

ANGLE [double|auto|follow|attribute]
    - Angle, given in degrees, to draw the label.  
    - AUTO allows MapServer to compute the angle. Valid for LINE
      layers only.
    - FOLLOW was introduced in version 4.10 and tells MapServer to
      compute a curved label for appropriate linear features (see
      :ref:`RFC11` for specifics).
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for angle values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYANGLE" that holds angle values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  150 150 150
          OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; ANTIALIAS

ANTIALIAS [true|false]
    Should text be antialiased? Note that this requires more available
    colors, decreases drawing performance, and results in slightly
    larger output images.  Only useful for GD (gif) rendering.
    Default is false.  Has no effect for the other renderers (where
    anti-aliasing can not be turned off).

BACKGROUNDCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to draw a background rectangle (i.e. billboard). Off by default.

    .. deprecated:: 6.0  Use STYLE object and `GEOMTRANSFORM labelpoly`.

BACKGROUNDSHADOWCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to draw a background rectangle (i.e. billboard) shadow. Off by 
    default.

    .. deprecated:: 6.0  Use STYLE object and `GEOMTRANSFORM labelpoly`.

BUFFER [integer]
    Padding, in pixels, around labels. Useful for maintaining spacing around 
    text to enhance readability. Available only for cached labels. 
    Default is 0.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; COLOR

COLOR [r] [g] [b] | [attribute]
    - Color to draw text with.
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for color values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYCOLOR" that holds color values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; ENCODING

ENCODING [string]
    Supported encoding format to be used for labels. If the format is not 
    supported, the label will not be drawn. Requires the iconv library 
    (present on most systems). The library is always detected if present on 
    the system, but if not the label will not be drawn.

    Required for displaying international characters in
    MapServer. More information can be found in the :ref:`Label
    Encoding document <labelencoding>`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; FONT

FONT [name|attribute]
    - Font alias (as defined in the FONTSET) to use for labeling.
    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.6 to specfify the font
      alias.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; FORCE

.. _FORCE:

FORCE [true|false]
    Forces labels for a particular class on, regardless of collisions. 
    Available only for cached labels. Default is false.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXLENGTH

.. _MAXLENGTH:

MAXLENGTH [integer]
    Introduced in mapserver 5.4, this keyword interacts with the WRAP_
    keyword so that line breaks only occur after the defined number of
    characters.

        **no wrap** ,no processing,skip label if it contains more than MAXLENGTH_ characters , hard wrap (always break at exactly MAXLENGTH_ characters)

    The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC40`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXOVERLAPANGLE

MAXOVERLAPANGLE [double]
    Angle threshold to use in filtering out ANGLE FOLLOW labels in
    which characters overlap (floating point value in degrees). This
    filtering will be enabled by default starting with MapServer
    6.0. The default MAXOVERLAPANGLE value will be 22.5 degrees, which
    also matches the default in GeoServer. Users will be free to tune
    the value up or down depending on the type of data they are
    dealing with and their tolerance to bad overlap in labels.
    As per RFC 60, if MAXOVERLAPANGLE is set to 0, then we fall back
    on pre-6.0 behavior which was to use maxoverlapangle = 0.4*MS_PI
    (40% of 180 degrees = 72degree).

    The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC60`.
                   
.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MAXSIZE

MAXSIZE [double]
    Maximum font size to use when scaling text (pixels). Default is 256.
    Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a fractional value 
    (and not only integer).
    See :ref:`LAYER` :ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM <symbolscaledenom>`.   

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MINDISTANCE

MINDISTANCE [integer]
    Minimum distance between duplicate labels. Given in pixels.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MINFEATURESIZE

MINFEATURESIZE [integer|auto]
    Minimum size a feature must be to be labeled. Given in pixels. For
    line data the overall length of the displayed line is used, for
    polygons features the smallest dimension of the bounding box is
    used. "Auto" keyword tells MapServer to only label features that
    are larger than their corresponding label. Available for cached
    labels only.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; MINSIZE

MINSIZE [double]
    Minimum font size to use when scaling text (pixels). Default is 4.
    Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a fractional value 
    (and not only integer).     
    See :ref:`LAYER` :ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM <symbolscaledenom>`.   

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OFFSET

OFFSET [x][y]
    Offset values for labels, relative to the lower left hand corner of the 
    label and the label point. Given in pixels. In the case of rotated text 
    specify the values as if all labels are horizontal and any rotation will 
    be compensated for.
    See :ref:`LAYER` :ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM <symbolscaledenom>`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OUTLINECOLOR

.. _OUTLINECOLOR:

OUTLINECOLOR [r] [g] [b] | [attribute]
    - Color to draw a one pixel outline around the characters in the text.
    - [*attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for color values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYOUTCOLOR" that holds color values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  150 150 150
          OUTLINECOLOR [MYOUTCOLOR]

        END 

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; OUTLINEWIDTH

OUTLINEWIDTH [integer]
    Width of the outline if OUTLINECOLOR_ has been set. Defaults to 1. 
    Currently only the AGG renderer supports values greater than 1, and
    renders these as a 'halo' effect: recommended values are 3 or 5.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; PARTIALS

PARTIALS [true|false]
    Can text run off the edge of the map? Default is true.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; POSITION

POSITION [ul|uc|ur|cl|cc|cr|ll|lc|lr|auto]
    Position of the label relative to the labeling point (layers
    only). First letter is "Y" position, second letter is "X"
    position. "Auto" tells MapServer to calculate a label position
    that will not interfere with other labels. With points, MapServer
    selects from the 8 outer positions (i.e. excluding cc). With
    polygons, MapServer selects from cc (added in MapServer 5.4), uc,
    lc, cl and cr as possible positions.  With lines, it only uses lc
    or uc, until it finds a position that doesn't collide with labels
    that have already been drawn. If all positions cause a conflict,
    then the label is not drawn (Unless the label's FORCE_ a parameter
    is set to "true"). "Auto" placement is only available with cached
    labels.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; PRIORITY

PRIORITY [integer]|[item_name]|[attribute]
     The priority parameter (added in v5.0) takes an integer value
     between 1 (lowest) and 10 (highest). The default value is 1. It
     is also possible to bind the priority to an attribute (item_name)
     using square brackets around the [item_name]. e.g. "PRIORITY
     [someattribute]"

     Labels are stored in the label cache and rendered in order of
     priority, with the highest priority levels rendered first.
     Specifying an out of range PRIORITY value inside a map file will
     result in a parsing error. An out of range value set via
     MapScript or coming from a shape attribute will be clamped to the
     min/max values at rendering time.  There is no expected impact on
     performance for using label priorities.

     [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.6.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; REPEATDISTANCE

REPEATDISTANCE [integer] 
    - Introduced in version 5.6. The label will be repeated on every
      line of a multiline shape and will be repeated multiple times
      along a given line at an interval of REPEATDISTANCE pixels.

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC57`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SHADOWCOLOR

SHADOWCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color of drop shadow. An label with the same text will be rendered
    in this color before the main label is drawn, resulting in a
    shadow effect on the the label characters. The offset of the
    renderered shadow is set with SHADOWSIZE.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SHADOWSIZE

SHADOWSIZE [x][y]|[attribute][attribute]|[x][attribute]|[attribute][y]
     Shadow offset in pixels, see SHADOWCOLOR.

     [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 6.0, and can be used like:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        SHADOWSIZE 2 2
        SHADOWSIZE [shadowsizeX] 2
        SHADOWSIZE 2 [shadowsizeY]
        SHADOWSIZE [shadowsize] [shadowsize]


.. index::
   pair: LABEL; SIZE

SIZE [double]|[tiny|small|medium|large|giant]|[attribute]
    - Text size. Use a number to give the size in pixels of your
      TrueType font based label, or any of the other 5 listed keywords
      for bitmap fonts.

      When scaling is in effect (:ref:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM
      <symbolscaledenom>` is specified for the :ref:`LAYER`), `SIZE`
      gives the size of the font to be used at the map scale
      1:`SYMBOLSCALEDENOM`.

    - Starting from version 5.4, the value can also be a fractional
      value (and not only integer).

    - [*Attribute*] was introduced in version 5.0, to specify the item
      name in the attribute table to use for size values.  The hard
      brackets [] are required.  For example, if your shapefile's DBF
      has a field named "MYSIZE" that holds size values for each
      record, your LABEL object might contain:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABEL
          COLOR  150 150 150
          OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255     
          FONT "sans"
          TYPE truetype
          SIZE [MYSIZE]
          POSITION AUTO      
          PARTIALS FALSE
        END 

      The associated RFC document for this feature is :ref:`RFC19`.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; STYLE

:ref:`STYLE`
    The start of a `STYLE` object.

    Label specific mechanisms of the STYLE object are the
    GEOMTRANSFORM options:

    GEOMTRANSFORM [labelpnt|labelpoly]
      Creates geometries that can be used for styling the label.

      - labelpnt generates a point with its center at the middle of
        the bounding rectangle of the text.

      - labelpoly generates the bounding rectangle for the text, with
        1 pixel of padding added in all directions.

      The resulting geometries can be styled using the mechanisms
      available in the `STYLE` object.

    .. versionadded:: 6.0


.. index::
   pair: LABEL; TYPE

TYPE [bitmap|truetype]
    Type of font to use. Generally bitmap fonts are faster to draw
    then TrueType fonts. However, TrueType fonts are scalable and
    available in a variety of faces. Be sure to set the FONT parameter
    if you select TrueType.
    
    .. note::
         Bitmap fonts are only supported with the AGG and GD
         renderers.

.. index::
   pair: LABEL; WRAP

.. _WRAP:

WRAP [character]
    Character that represents an end-of-line condition in label text,
    thus resulting in a multi-line label. Interacts with MAXLENGTH_
    for conditional line wrapping after a given number of characters
