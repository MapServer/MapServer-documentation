.. index::
   pair: WEB; BROWSEFORMAT

BROWSEFORMAT [mime-type]
    Format of the interface output, using MapServer CGI. *(added to MapServer 4.8.0)* 
    The default value is "text/html". Example:
    
    .. code-block:: mapfile
    
        BROWSEFORMAT "image/svg+xml"

.. index::
   pair: WEB; EMPTY

EMPTY [url]
    URL to forward users to if a query fails. If not defined the value for 
    ERROR is used.

.. index::
   pair: WEB; ERROR

ERROR [url]
    URL to forward users to if an error occurs. Ugly old MapServer error 
    messages will appear if this is not defined

.. index::
   pair: WEB; FOOTER

FOOTER [filename]
    Template to use AFTER anything else is sent. Multiresult query modes only.

.. index::
   pair: WEB; HEADER

HEADER [filename]
    Template to use BEFORE everything else has been sent. Multiresult query 
    modes only.

.. index::
   pair: WEB; IMAGEPATH

IMAGEPATH [path]
    Path to the temporary directory fro writing temporary files and images. 
    Must be writable by the user the web server is running as. Must end 
    with a / or \ depending on your platform.

.. index::
   pair: WEB; IMAGEURL

IMAGEURL [path]
    Base URL for IMAGEPATH. This is the URL that will take the web browser 
    to IMAGEPATH to get the images.
    
.. index::
   pair: WEB; LEGENDFORMAT

LEGENDFORMAT [mime-type]
    Format of the legend output, using MapServer CGI. *(added to MapServer 4.8.0)*  
    The default value is "text/html".  Example:
    
    .. code-block:: mapfile
    
        LEGENDFORMAT "image/svg+xml"     

LOG [filename]
    Since MapServer 5.0 the recommeded parameters to use for debugging are the :ref:`MAP`
    object's CONFIG and DEBUG parameters instead (see the :ref:`debugging` document). 
    
    File to log MapServer activity in. Must be writable by the user the web 
    server is running as.
    
    .. deprecated:: 5.0  

.. index::
   pair: WEB; MAXSCALEDENOM

MAXSCALEDENOM [double]
    Minimum scale at which this interface is valid. When a user requests a map
    at a smaller scale, MapServer automatically returns the map at this scale.
    This effectively prevents user from zooming too far out.  Scale is given as
    the denominator of the actual scale fraction, for example for a map at a
    scale of 1:24,000 use 24000.  Implemented in MapServer 5.0, to replace the
    deprecated MAXSCALE parameter.

        :term:`Map scale`

MAXSCALE [double] - deprecated
    Since MapServer 5.0 the proper parameter to use is MAXSCALEDENOM instead.
    The deprecated MAXSCALE is the minimum scale at which this interface is
    valid. When a user requests a map at a smaller scale, MapServer automatically
    returns the map at this scale. This effectively prevents user from zooming
    too far out.  Scale is given as the denominator of the actual scale
    fraction, for example for a map at a scale of 1:24,000 use 24000.

    .. deprecated:: 5.0

.. index::
   pair: WEB; MAXTEMPLATE

MAXTEMPLATE [file|url]
    Template to be used if below the minimum scale for the app (the
    denominator of the requested scale is larger than MAXSCALEDENOM),
    useful for nesting apps.

.. index::
   pair: WEB; METADATA

METADATA
    This keyword allows for arbitrary data to be stored as name value pairs. 
    This is used with OGC WMS to define things such as layer title. It can 
    also allow more flexibility in creating templates, as anything you put 
    in here will be accessible via template tags.
    Example:
    
    .. code-block:: mapfile

        METADATA
            title "My layer title"
            author "Me!"
        END

.. index::
   pair: WEB; MINSCALEDENOM

MINSCALEDENOM [double]
    Maximum scale at which this interface is valid. When a user reqests a 
    map at a larger scale, MapServer automatically returns the map at this 
    scale. This effectively prevents the user from zooming in too far. 
    Scale is given as the denominator of the actual scale fraction, for example
    for a map at a scale of 1:24,000 use 24000.  Implemented in MapServer 5.0, to
    replace the deprecated MINSCALE parameter.

    .. seealso::
        
        :term:`Map scale`

MINSCALE [double] - deprecated
    Since MapServer 5.0 the proper parameter to use is MINSCALEDENOM
    instead.  The deprecated MINSCALE is the maximum scale at which this
    interface is valid. When a user reqests a map at a larger scale, MapServer
    automatically returns the map at this scale. This effectively prevents the
    user from zooming in too far.  Scale is given as the denominator of the

.. index::
   pair: WEB; MINTEMPLATE

MINTEMPLATE
    Template to be used if above the maximum scale for the app (the
    denominator of the requested scale is smaller than MINSCALEDENOM),
    useful for nesting apps.
    
.. index::
   pair: WEB; QUERYFORMAT

QUERYFORMAT [mime-type]
    Format of the query output. *(added to MapServer 4.8.0)*  This works for 
    mode=query (using query templates in CGI mode), but not for mode=browse.  
    The default value is "text/html".  Example:
    
    .. code-block:: mapfile
    
        QUERYFORMAT "image/svg+xml"      

.. index::
   pair: WEB; TEMPLATE

TEMPLATE [filename|url]
    Template file or URL to use in presenting the results to the user in an 
    interactive mode (i.e. map generates map and so on ... )

.. index::
   pair: WEB; VALIDATION

VALIDATION
    Signals the start of a `VALIDATION` block.

    As of MapServer 5.4.0, `VALIDATION` blocks are the preferred
    mechanism for specifying validation patterns for CGI param runtime
    substitutions.  See :ref:`RUNSUB`.
