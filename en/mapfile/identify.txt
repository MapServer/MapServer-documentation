Controls how vector features are identified, typically through WMS GetFeatureInfo
or MODE=QUERY requests.

.. _identify_tolerance:

TOLERANCE [double]
    Sensitivity for point based queries (i.e. via mouse and/or map
    coordinates). Given in TOLERANCEUNITS. If the layer is a POINT or a LINE,
    the default is 3. For all other layer types, the default is 0.  To
    restrict polygon searches so that the point must occur in the polygon
    set the tolerance to zero. This setting does not apply to WFS GetFeature
    operations.

.. index::
   pair: IDENTIFY; TOLERANCEUNITS
   :name: mapfile-identify-toleranceunits

.. _identify_tolerance_units:

TOLERANCEUNITS [pixels|feet|inches|kilometers|meters|miles|nauticalmiles|dd]
    Units of the TOLERANCE value. Default is pixels.

CLASSAUTO

    By default, identification of point features is based on their location,
    potentially extended with the radius defined by TOLERANCE value.

    When setting the CLASSAUTO keyword, symbols from the style classes used to
    render the incoming WMS GetFeatureInfo request are used for more precise
    identification, by recognizing non-transparent pixels of the symbol.

    The TOLERANCE value is also used to extend sensitive pixels beyond
    non-transparent pixels of the symbol.

    This option is mutually exclusive with CLASSGROUP.

    This option is currently only honoured on layers of type POINT using
    SYMBOL.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: mapfile

        IDENTIFY
            TOLERANCE 5  # optional
            CLASSAUTO
        END

        CLASS
            GROUP "my_style_group"
            STYLE
                SYMBOL "my_symbol"
            END
        END


.. index::
   pair: IDENTIFY; CLASSGROUP
   :name: mapfile-identify-classgroup

CLASSGROUP [string]

    By default, identification of point features is based on their location,
    potentially extended with the radius defined by TOLERANCE value.

    When setting the CLASSGROUP keyword, symbols from the specified class's group
    are used for more precise identification, by recognizing non-transparent
    pixels of the symbol.

    The :ref:`CLASS` object's GROUP parameter must be used in combination with
    CLASSGROUP.

    The TOLERANCE value is also used to extend sensitive pixels beyond
    non-transparent pixels of the symbol.

    This option is mutually exclusive with CLASSAUTO.

    This option is currently only honoured on layers of type POINT using
    SYMBOL.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: mapfile

        IDENTIFY
            TOLERANCE 5  # optional
            CLASSGROUP "my_style_group"
        END

        CLASS
            GROUP "my_style_group"
            STYLE
                SYMBOL "my_symbol"
            END
        END
