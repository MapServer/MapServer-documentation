 OUTPUTFORMAT
*****************************************************************************

A map file may have zero, one or more OUTPUTFORMAT object declarations, 
defining available output formats supported including formats like PNG, 
GIF, JPEG, GeoTIFF, SVG, PDF and KML.

If OUTPUTFORMAT sections declarations are not found in the map file, the 
following implicit declarations will be made. Only those for which support 
is compiled in will actually be available. The GeoTIFF depends on building 
with GDAL support, and the PDF and SVG depend on building with cairo support.

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; DRIVER
    
DRIVER [name]
    The name of the driver to use to generate this output format. Some driver 
    names include the definition of the format if the driver supports multiple 
    formats. For AGG, the possbile driver names are "AGG/PNG" and "AGG/JPEG".
    For GD the possible driver names are "GD/Gif" and "GD/PNG".
    For output through OGR the OGR driver name is appended, such as 
    "OGR/Mapinfo File".  For output through GDAL the GDAL shortname for the 
    format is appended, such as "GDAL/GTiff". Note that PNG, JPEG and GIF 
    output can be generated with either GDAL or GD (GD is generally more 
    efficient).  TEMPLATE should be used for template based output. (mandatory)

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; EXTENSION
    
EXTENSION [type]
    Provide the extension to use when creating files of this type. (optional)


.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION
    
.. _FORMATOPTION:

FORMATOPTION [option]
    Provides a driver or format specific option. Zero or more FORMATOPTION 
    statement may be present within a OUTPUTFORMAT declaration. (optional)

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; QUALITY

    - AGG/JPEG: The "QUALITY=n" option may be used to set the quality of 
      jpeg produced (value from 0-100).

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; INTERLACE

    - GD/PNG: The "INTERLACE=[ON/OFF]" option may be used to turn 
      interlacing on or off.

    - GD/GIF: The "INTERLACE=[ON/OFF]" option may be used to turn 
      interlacing on or off.

    .. index::

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; BLOCKXSIZE

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; BLOCKYSIZE

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; INTERLEAVE

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; COMPRESS

    - GDAL/GTiff: Supports the TILED=YES, BLOCKXSIZE=n, BLOCKYSIZE=n, 
      INTERLEAVE=[PIXEL/BAND] and COMPRESS=[NONE,PACKBITS,JPEG,LZW,DEFLATE] 
      format specific options.

    - GDAL/\*: All FORMATOPTIONs are passed onto the GDAL create function. 
      Options supported by GDAL are described in the detailed documentation 
      for each GDAL format

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; NULLVALUE

    - GDAL/\*: NULLVALUE=n is used in raw image modes (IMAGEMODE 
      BYTE/INT16/FLOAT) to pre-initialize the raster and an attempt is made
      to record this in the resulting file as the nodata value. This is
      automatically set in WCS mode if rangeset_nullvalue is set. 

    - OGR/\*: See OGR Output document for details of OGR format options.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; GAMMA

    - AGG/\*: GAMMA=n is used to specify the gamma correction to apply to polygon
      rendering. Allowed values are ]0.0,1.0] , default is 0.75. This value is
      used to prevent artifacts from appearing on the border of contiguous
      polygons. Set to 1.0 to disable gamma correction.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; COMPRESSION

    - AGG/PNG: COMPRESSION=n is used to determine the ZLIB compression applied to
      the png creation. n is expected to be an integer value from 0 to 9, with 0
      meaning *no* compression (not recommended), 1 meaning fastest compression,
      and 9 meaning best compression. The compression levels come at a cost (be it
      in terms of cpu processing or file size, chose the setting that suits you
      most). The default is COMPRESSION=6.

    - AGG/PNG supports quantizing from 24/32 bits to 8bits,
      in order to reduce the final image size (and therefore save bandwidth) (see
      also http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/2436#comment:4 for strategies
      when applying these options):

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; QUANTIZE_FORCE

      - "QUANTIZE_FORCE=on" used to reduce an RGB or RGBA image into an 8bit 
          (or less) paletted images. The colors used in the palette are selected
          to best fit the actual colors in the RGB or RGBA image.
 
      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; QUANTIZE_COLORS

      - "QUANTIZE_COLORS=256" used to specify the number of colors to be used
        when applying quantization. Maximum value is 256. Specifying anything
        between 17 and 255 is probably a waste of quality as each pixel is still
        encoded with a full byte. Specifying a value under 16 will produce tiny
        images, but severly degraded.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; PALETTE

      - "PALETTE=/path/to/palette.txt" is used to define the absolute path where 
        palette colors can be found. This file must contain 256 entries of r,g,b
        triplets for RGB imagemodes, or r,g,b,a quadruplets for
        RGBA imagemodes. The expected format is one triplet (or quadruplet) per
        line, each value separated by commas, and each triplet/quadruplet on a
        single line. If you want to use transparency with a palette, it is
        important to have these two colors in the palette file:
        0,0,0,0 and 255,255,255,255.

        .. NOTE::
	   0,0,0,0 is important if you have fully transparent areas.
	   255,255,255,255 is opaque white.
           The important colors to have in your palette really depend on your
	   actual map, although 0,0,0,0 , 0,0,0,255 , and 255,255,255,255 are
	   very likely to show up most of the time.
	   
      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; PALETTE_FORCE

      - "PALETTE_FORCE=on" is used to reduce image depth with a predefined palette.
        To allow additional colours for anti-aliasing other than those in the 
        predefined palette, use with "QUANTIZE_COLORS".

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE
    
IMAGEMODE [PC256/RGB/RGBA/INT16/FLOAT32/FEATURE]
    Selects the imaging mode in which the output is generated. Does matter 
    for non-raster formats like Flash. Not all formats support all 
    combinations. For instance GD supports only PC256. (optional)

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; PC256

    - PC256: Produced a pseudocolored result with up to 256 colors in 
      the palette (legacy MapServer mode). Only supported for GD/GIF
      and GD/PNG.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; RGB

    - RGB: Render in 24bit Red/Green/Blue mode. Supports all colors 
      but does not support transparency.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; RGBA

    - RGBA: Render in 32bit Red/Green/Blue/Alpha mode. Supports all 
      colors, and alpha based transparency. All features are rendered
      against an initially transparent background.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; BYTE

    - BYTE:  Render raw 8bit pixel values (no presentation).  Only 
      works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) and WMS layers currently.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; INT16

    - INT16: Render raw 16bit signed pixel values (no presentation). 
      Only works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) and WMS layers currently.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; FLOAT32

    - FLOAT32: Render raw 32bit floating point pixel values 
      (no presentation). Only works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) 
      and WMS layers currently.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; FEATURE

    - FEATURE: Output is a non-image result, such as features written 
      via templates or OGR.  

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; MIMETYPE
    
MIMETYPE [type]
    Provide the mime type to be used when returning results over the web. 
    (optional)

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; NAME
    
NAME [name]
    The name to use in the IMAGETYPE keyword of the map file to 
    select this output format.  This name is also used in metadata describing
    wxs formats allowed, and can be used (sometimes along with mimetype) to 
    select the output format via keywords in OGC requests. (optional)

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; TRANSPARENT
    
TRANSPARENT [ON/OFF]
    Indicates whether transparency should be enabled for this format. Note 
    that transparency does not work for IMAGEMODE RGB output. Not all formats 
    support transparency (optional). When transparency is enabled for the 
    typical case of 8-bit pseudocolored map generation, the IMAGECOLOR color 
    will be marked as transparent in the output file palette. Any other map 
    components drawn in this color will also be transparent, so for map 
    generation with transparency it is best to use an otherwise unused color 
    as the background color.
