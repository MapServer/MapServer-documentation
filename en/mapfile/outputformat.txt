 OUTPUTFORMAT
*****************************************************************************

A map file may have zero, one or more OUTPUTFORMAT object declarations, 
defining available output formats supported including formats like PNG, 
GIF, JPEG, GeoTIFF, SVG, PDF and KML.

If OUTPUTFORMAT sections declarations are not found in the map file, the 
following implicit declarations will be made. Only those for which support 
is compiled in will actually be available. The GeoTIFF depends on building 
with GDAL support, and the PDF and SVG depend on building with cairo support.

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; DRIVER
   :name: mapfile-outputformat-driver
    
DRIVER [name]
    The name of the driver to use to generate this output format. Some driver 
    names include the definition of the format if the driver supports multiple 
    formats. For AGG, the possible driver names are "AGG/PNG" and "AGG/JPEG".
    For output through OGR the OGR driver name is appended, such as 
    "OGR/Mapinfo File".  For output through GDAL the GDAL shortname for the 
    format is appended, such as "GDAL/GTiff". Note that PNG and JPEG 
    output can be generated with either GDAL or AGG (AGG is generally more 
    efficient).  TEMPLATE should be used for template based output. (mandatory).
    Other drivers: KML, KMZ and UTFGRID.

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; EXTENSION
   :name: mapfile-outputformat-extension

EXTENSION [type]
    Provide the extension to use when creating files of this type. (optional)


.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION
   :name: mapfile-outputformat-formatoption
    
.. _FORMATOPTION:

FORMATOPTION [option]
    Provides a driver or format specific option. Zero or more FORMATOPTION 
    statement may be present within a OUTPUTFORMAT declaration. (optional)

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; GAMMA

    - AGG/\*: "GAMMA=n" is used to specify the gamma correction to
      apply to polygon rendering. Allowed values are [0.0,1.0] ,
      default is 0.75. This value is used to prevent artifacts from
      appearing on the border of contiguous polygons. Set to 1.0 to
      disable gamma correction.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; QUALITY

    - AGG/JPEG: The "QUALITY=n" option may be used to set the quality of 
      jpeg produced (value from 0-100).

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; COMPRESSION

    - AGG/PNG: "COMPRESSION=n" is used to determine the ZLIB
      compression applied to the png creation. n is expected to be an
      integer value from 0 to 9, with 0 meaning *no* compression (not
      recommended), 1 meaning fastest compression, and 9 meaning best
      compression. The compression levels come at a cost (be it in
      terms of cpu processing or file size, chose the setting that
      suits you most). The default is COMPRESSION=6.

    - AGG/PNG supports quantizing from 24/32 bits to 8bits, in order
      to reduce the final image size (and therefore save bandwidth)
      (see also `MapServer issue #2436`_
      for strategies when applying these options):

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; QUANTIZE_FORCE

      - "QUANTIZE_FORCE=on" used to reduce an RGB or RGBA image into
        an 8bit (or less) paletted images. The colors used in the
        palette are selected to best fit the actual colors in the RGB
        or RGBA image.
 
      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; QUANTIZE_COLORS

      - "QUANTIZE_COLORS=256" used to specify the number of colors to
        be used when applying quantization. Maximum value is
        256. Specifying anything between 17 and 255 is probably a
        waste of quality as each pixel is still encoded with a full
        byte. Specifying a value under 16 will produce tiny images,
        but severely degraded.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; PALETTE

      - "PALETTE=/path/to/palette.txt" is used to define the absolute
        path where palette colors can be found. This file must contain
        256 entries of r,g,b triplets for RGB imagemodes, or r,g,b,a
        quadruplets for RGBA imagemodes. The expected format is one
        triplet (or quadruplet) per line, each value separated by
        commas, and each triplet/quadruplet on a single line. If you
        want to use transparency with a palette, it is important to
        have these two colors in the palette file: 0,0,0,0 and
        255,255,255,255.

        .. NOTE::
	   0,0,0,0 is important if you have fully transparent areas.
	   255,255,255,255 is opaque white.
           The important colors to have in your palette really depend
	   on your actual map, although 0,0,0,0 , 0,0,0,255 , and
	   255,255,255,255 are very likely to show up most of the
	   time.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; PALETTE_FORCE

      - "PALETTE_FORCE=on" is used to reduce image depth with a
        predefined palette.  This option is incompatible with the
        previous quantization options. To allow additional colours 
        for anti-aliasing other than those in the predefined 
        palette, use with "QUANTIZE_COLORS". 

    .. index::
       pair: PDF; Geospatial

    - AGG/MIXED
    
      .. versionadded:: 7.2
      
      AGG/MIXED is a meta driver that automatically selects the appropriate format
      depending if the result image has transparency or not. It requires the
      TRANSPARENT_FORMAT and OPAQUE_FORMAT options to be defined and set to
      another valid format. The valid formats for TRANSPARENT_FORMAT and
      OPAQUE_FORMAT are those handled by the AGG/PNG, AGG/JPEG or GDAL/xxxx
      drivers. By default, the "jpeg_png" format (with "image/vnd.jpeg-png" mime
      type) is pre-configured to use PNG images when they are non-opaque pixels
      and JPEG when they are only opaque pixels. Similarly a "jpeg_png8" format
      (with "image/vnd.jpeg-png8" mime type) is pre-configured to use PNG 8bits
      images when they are non-opaque pixels and JPEG when they are only opaque
      pixels.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; TRANSPARENT_FORMAT

      - "TRANSPARENT_FORMAT=name": which output format to be used when the
        image contains non-opaque/transparent pixels.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; OPAQUE_FORMAT

      - "OPAQUE_FORMAT=name": which output format to be used when the
        image contains only opaque pixels.
 
      Example:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        OUTPUTFORMAT
          NAME "jpeg_low"
          MIMETYPE "image/jpeg; quality=50"
          DRIVER AGG/JPEG
          IMAGEMODE RGB
          FORMATOPTION "QUALITY=50"
        END

        OUTPUTFORMAT
          NAME "jpeg_low_png"
          MIMETYPE "image/vnd.jpeg-png; quality=50"
          DRIVER AGG/MIXED
          IMAGEMODE RGBA
          FORMATOPTION "TRANSPARENT_FORMAT=png"
          FORMATOPTION "OPAQUE_FORMAT=jpeg_low"
        END

    - CAIRO/PDF:

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; GEO_ENCODING

      - "GEO_ENCODING=ISO32000" or "GEO_ENCODING=OGC_BP": 
      
        .. versionadded:: 6.2      
      
        Geospatial PDF will be generated.  Requires GDAL 1.10 with PDF driver.
        See the `GDAL Geospatial PDF`_ documentation for requirements.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; METADATA_ITEM

      - "METADATA_ITEM:option=value": 
      
        .. versionadded:: 6.2
        
        Additional PDF options can be
        provided using the METADATA_ITEM prefix.  The following
        options are available: `AUTHOR`, `CREATOR`, `CREATION_DATE`,
        `KEYWORDS`, `PRODUCER`, `SUBJECT`, `TITLE`.

      Example:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        OUTPUTFORMAT
          NAME pdf
          DRIVER "CAIRO/PDF"
          MIMETYPE "application/x-pdf"
          IMAGEMODE RGB
          EXTENSION "pdf"
          FORMATOPTION "GEO_ENCODING=ISO32000"
          FORMATOPTION "METADATA_ITEM:CREATOR=MapServer, with GDAL trunk"
          FORMATOPTION "METADATA_ITEM:PRODUCER=MapServer, with GDAL trunk"
        END


    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; INTERLACE

    - GD/PNG: The "INTERLACE=[ON/OFF]" option may be used to turn 
      interlacing on or off.

      .. Warning::

         GD support was removed in MapServer 7.0.

    - GD/GIF: The "INTERLACE=[ON/OFF]" option may be used to turn 
      interlacing on or off.

      .. Warning::

         GD support was removed in MapServer 7.0.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; TILED

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; BLOCKXSIZE

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; BLOCKYSIZE

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; INTERLEAVE

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; COMPRESS

    - GDAL/GTiff: Supports the "TILED=YES", "BLOCKXSIZE=n",
      "BLOCKYSIZE=n", "INTERLEAVE=[PIXEL/BAND]" and
      "COMPRESS=[NONE,PACKBITS,JPEG,LZW,DEFLATE]" format specific
      options.

    - GDAL/\*: All FORMATOPTIONs are passed onto the GDAL create function. 
      Options supported by GDAL are described in the detailed documentation 
      for each GDAL format.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; NULLVALUE

    - GDAL/\*: "NULLVALUE=n" is used in raw image modes (IMAGEMODE 
      BYTE/INT16/FLOAT) to pre-initialize the raster and an attempt is made
      to record this in the resulting file as the nodata value. This is
      automatically set in WCS mode if rangeset_nullvalue is set. 

    - OGR/\*: See the :ref:`ogr_output` document for details of OGR
      format options.

    .. index::
       pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; UTFGRID
       :name: mapfile-outputformat-utfgrid

    - UTFGRID: See :ref:`rfc93`.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; LABELS

      - "LABELS=true".  Labels can be rendered using their parent
        feature id (derived via UTFITEM) where the labels bounding box
        is drawn to the map.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; UTFRESOLUTION

      - "UTFRESOLUTION=4".  The resolution of the grid.  A larger
        resolution will make the grid smaller and therefore reduce its
        weight but also its precision.

      .. index::
         triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; FORMATOPTION; DUPLICATES

      - "DUPLICATES=false".  It may be desirable NOT to remove
        duplicate feature id/key pairs since that process could be
        expensive depending on the number of features in the map. This
        option can be used to skip this step. The resulting JSON file
        will be a bit larger.

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE
   :name: mapfile-outputformat-imagemode
    
IMAGEMODE [PC256|RGB|RGBA|INT16|FLOAT32|FEATURE]
    Selects the imaging mode in which the output is generated. Does matter 
    for non-raster formats like Flash. Not all formats support all 
    combinations. (optional)

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; PC256

    - PC256: Produced a pseudocolored result with up to 256 colors in 
      the palette (legacy MapServer mode). Only supported for GD/GIF
      and GD/PNG.

      .. Warning::

         GD support was removed in MapServer 7.0.
         
    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; RGB

    - RGB: Render in 24bit Red/Green/Blue mode. Supports all colors 
      but does not support transparency.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; RGBA

    - RGBA: Render in 32bit Red/Green/Blue/Alpha mode. Supports all 
      colors, and alpha based transparency. All features are rendered
      against an initially transparent background.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; BYTE

    - BYTE:  Render raw 8bit pixel values (no presentation).  Only 
      works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) and WMS layers currently.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; INT16

    - INT16: Render raw 16bit signed pixel values (no presentation). 
      Only works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) and WMS layers currently.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; FLOAT32

    - FLOAT32: Render raw 32bit floating point pixel values 
      (no presentation). Only works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) 
      and WMS layers currently.

    .. index::
       triple: OUTPUTFORMAT; IMAGEMODE; FEATURE

    - FEATURE: Output is a non-image result, such as features written 
      via templates or OGR.  

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; MIMETYPE
   :name: mapfile-outputformat-mimetype
    
MIMETYPE [type]
    Provide the mime type to be used when returning results over the web. 
    (optional)

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; NAME
   :name: mapfile-outputformat-name
    
NAME [name]
    The name to use in the IMAGETYPE keyword of the map file to 
    select this output format.  This name is also used in metadata describing
    wxs formats allowed, and can be used (sometimes along with mimetype) to 
    select the output format via keywords in OGC requests. (optional)

.. index::
   pair: OUTPUTFORMAT; TRANSPARENT
   :name: mapfile-outputformat-transparent
    
TRANSPARENT [on|off]
    Indicates whether transparency should be enabled for this format. Note 
    that transparency does not work for IMAGEMODE RGB output. Not all formats 
    support transparency (optional). When transparency is enabled for the 
    typical case of 8-bit pseudocolored map generation, the IMAGECOLOR color 
    will be marked as transparent in the output file palette. Any other map 
    components drawn in this color will also be transparent, so for map 
    generation with transparency it is best to use an otherwise unused color 
    as the background color.
