Description
-----------

Since version 6.0, MapServer has the ability to display features from multiple
vector layers (called *'source layers'*) in a single mapfile layer. This
feature was added through :ref:`rfc68`. Raster layers cannot be combined using
this feature.

Requirements
------------

This is a native MapServer option that doesn't use any external
libraries to support it.

Mapfile Configuration
---------------------

* The CONNECTIONTYPE parameter must be set to UNION.
* The CONNECTION parameter must contain a comma separated list of the
  source layer names.
* All of the source layers and the union layer must be the same TYPE
  (e.g. all must be TYPE POINT, or all TYPE POLYGON etc.)

.. note::
    You may wish to disable the visibility (change their STATUS) of
    the source layers to avoid displaying the features twice.
    
For example:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME "union-layer"  
      TYPE POINT
      STATUS DEFAULT      
      CONNECTIONTYPE UNION
      CONNECTION "layer1,layer2,layer3" # reference to the source layers
      PROCESSING "ITEMS=itemname1,itemname2,itemname3"      
      ...
    END
    LAYER
      NAME "layer1" 
      TYPE POINT
      STATUS OFF      
      CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
      CONNECTION ...
      ...
    END
    LAYER
      NAME "layer2"   
      TYPE POINT
      STATUS OFF    
      CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
      CONNECTION ...
      ...
    END
    LAYER
      NAME "layer3"   
      TYPE POINT
      STATUS OFF    
      CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
      CONNECTION ...
      ...
    END
    
Feature attributes
------------------

In the LAYER definition you may refer to any attributes supported by
each of the source layers.
In addition to the source layer attributes the union layer provides
the following additional attributes:

1) Union_SourceLayerName - The name of the source layer the feature belongs to
2) Union_SourceLayerGroup - The group of the source layer the feature belongs to

During the selection / feature query operations only the
'Union_SourceLayerName' and 'Union_SourceLayerGroup' attributes
are provided by default. The set of the provided attributes can
manually be overridden (and further attributes can be exposed) by
using the ITEMS processing option (refer to the example above).

Classes and Styles
------------------

We can define the symbology and labelling for the union layers in the
same way as for any other layer by specifying the classes and
styles. In addition the STYLEITEM AUTO option is also supported for
the union layer, which provides to display the features as specified
at the source layers. The source layers may also use the STYLEITEM
AUTO setting if the underlying data source provides that.

Projections
-----------

For speed, it is recommended to always use the same projection for the
union layer and source layers. However MapServer will reproject the
source layers to the union layer if requested.  (for more information
on projections in MapServer refer to :ref:`PROJECTION`)

Supported Processing Options
----------------------------

The following processing options can be used with the union layers:

UNION_STATUS_CHECK (TRUE or FALSE)
    Controls whether the status of the source layers should be checked and 
    the invisible layers (STATUS=OFF) should be skipped. Default value is FALSE.

UNION_SCALE_CHECK (TRUE or FALSE)
    Controls whether the scale range of the source layers should be checked and 
    the invisible layers (falling outside of the scale range and zoom range) 
    should be skipped. Default value is TRUE.

UNION_SRCLAYER_CLOSE_CONNECTION
    Override the connection pool setting of the source layers.
    By introducing this setting we alter the current behaviour which is equivalent to:

::

    UNION_SRCLAYER_CLOSE_CONNECTION=ALWAYS


Examples
--------

Mapfile Example
***************

The follow example contains 3 source layers in different formats, and
one layer (yellow) in a different projection.  The union layer uses
the **STYLEITEM "AUTO"** parameter to draw the styles from the source
layers.  (in this case MapServer will reproject the yellow features,
in EPSG:4326, for the union layer, which is in EPSG:3978).

.. code-block:: mapfile

  MAP
  ...
  PROJECTION
    "init=epsg:3978"
  END
  ...
  LAYER
    NAME 'unioned'
    TYPE POLYGON    
    STATUS DEFAULT
    CONNECTIONTYPE UNION
    CONNECTION "red,green,yellow"    
    STYLEITEM "AUTO"
    # Define an empty class that will be filled at runtime from the color and
    # styles read from each source layer.
    CLASS
    END
    PROJECTION
      "init=epsg:3978"
    END    
  END

  LAYER
    NAME 'red'
    TYPE POLYGON    
    STATUS OFF
    DATA 'nb.shp'
    CLASS
       NAME 'red' 
       STYLE
         OUTLINECOLOR 0 0 0
         COLOR 255 85 0
       END
    END
  END

  LAYER
    NAME 'green'
    TYPE POLYGON    
    STATUS OFF 
    CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
    CONNECTION 'ns.mif'
    CLASS
       NAME 'green' 
       STYLE
         OUTLINECOLOR 0 0 0
         COLOR 90 218 71
       END
    END
  END

  LAYER
    NAME 'yellow'
    TYPE POLYGON
    STATUS OFF  
    CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
    CONNECTION 'pei.gml'
    CLASS
       NAME 'yellow' 
       STYLE

PHP MapScript Example
*********************

.. code-block:: php

  <?php

  // open map
  $oMap = ms_newMapObj( "D:/ms4w/apps/osm/map/osm.map" );

  // create union layer
  $oLayer = ms_newLayerObj($oMap);
  $oLayer->set("name", "unioned");
  $oLayer->set("type", MS_LAYER_POLYGON); 
  $oLayer->set("status", MS_ON);
  $oLayer->setConnectionType(MS_UNION);
  $oLayer->set("connection", "red,green,yellow");
  $oLayer->set("styleitem", "AUTO");
  $oLayer->setProjection("init=epsg:3978");
  // create empty class
  $oClass = ms_newClassObj($oLayer);
  ...

  ?>
