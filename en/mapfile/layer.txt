    Inside a layer, only a single class will be used for the rendering
    of a feature. Each feature is tested against each class in the order
    in which they are defined in the mapfile. The first class that matches
    the its min/max scale constraints and its :ref:`EXPRESSION <expressions>`

   pair: LAYER; DATA

DATA [filename]|[sde parameters][postgis table/column][oracle table/column]
    Full filename of the spatial data to process. No file extension is
    necessary for shapefiles. Can be specified relative to the
    SHAPEPATH option from the Map Object.

    If this is an SDE layer, the parameter should include the name of
    the layer as well as the geometry column, i.e. "mylayer,shape,myversion".

    If this is a PostGIS layer, the parameter should be in the form of
    "<columnname> from <tablename>", where "columnname" is the name of the
    column containing the geometry objects and "tablename" is the name of the
    table from which the geometry data will be read.

    For Oracle, use "shape FROM table" or "shape FROM (SELECT statement)" or
    even more complex Oracle compliant queries! Note that there are important
    performance impacts when using spatial subqueries however. Try using
    MapServer's FILTER_ whenever possible instead. You can also see the SQL
    submitted by forcing an error, for instance by submitting a DATA parameter
    you know won't work, using for example a bad column name.

   pair: LAYER; DEBUG

DEBUG [off|on|0|1|2|3|4|5]
    Enables debugging of a layer in the current map.

    *Debugging with MapServer versions >= 5.0:*

    Verbose output is generated and sent to the standard error output
    (STDERR) or the MapServer errorfile if one is set using the
    "MS_ERRORFILE" environment variable.  You can set the environment
    variable by using the CONFIG parameter at the MAP level of the
    mapfile, such as:

    .. code-block:: mapfile

      CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"

    You can also set the environment variable in Apache by adding the
    following to your httpd.conf:

    ::

      SetEnv MS_ERRORFILE "/ms4w/tmp/ms_error.txt"

    Once the environment variable is set, the DEBUG mapfile parameter
    can be used to control the level of debugging output.  Here is a
    description of the possible DEBUG values:

    - **DEBUG O or OFF** - only msSetError() calls are logged to
      MS_ERRORFILE. No msDebug() output at all. This is the default
      and corresponds to the original behavior of MS_ERRORFILE in
      MapServer 4.x

    - **DEBUG 1 or ON** - includes all output from DEBUG 0 plus
      msDebug() warnings about common pitfalls, failed assertions or
      non-fatal error situations (e.g. missing or invalid values for
      some parameters, missing shapefiles in tileindex, timeout error
      from remote WMS/WFS servers, etc.)

    - **DEBUG 2** - includes all output from DEBUG 1 plus notices and timing
      information useful for tuning mapfiles and applications

    - **DEBUG 3** - all of DEBUG 2 plus some debug output useful in
      troubleshooting problems such as WMS connection URLs being called,
      database connection calls, etc. This is the recommended level for
      debugging mapfiles.

    - **DEBUG 4** - DEBUG 3 plus even more details...

    - **DEBUG 5** - DEBUG 4 plus any msDebug() output that might be
      more useful to the developers than to the users.

    You can also set the debug level by using the "MS_DEBUGLEVEL" environment
    variable.

    The DEBUG setting can also be specified for the entire map, by setting the
    DEBUG parameter in the :ref:`MAP` object.

    For more details on this debugging mechanism, please see :ref:`RFC28`.

    *Debugging with MapServer versions < 5:*

    Verbose output is generated and sent to the standard error output (STDERR)
    or the MapServer logfile if one is set using the LOG parameter in the WEB
    object.  Apache users will see timing details for drawing in Apache's
    error_log file.  Requires MapServer to be built with the DEBUG=MSDEBUG
    option (--with-debug configure option).

EXTENT [minx] [miny] [maxx] [maxy]
    The spatial extent of the data. In most cases you will not need

    MapServer compute the extents of the data.  An application can also
    possibly use this value to override the extents of the map.

FILTER [string]

    This parameter allows for data specific attribute filtering that
    is done at the same time spatial filtering is done, but before any
    CLASS expressions are evaluated.  The string is simply a MapServer
    :ref:`expression <expressions>`::

      FILTER ("[type]"='road' and [size]<2)

    Native filters are supported through the `NATIVE_FILTER`
    `PROCESSING` key::

         triple: LAYER; GEOMTRANSFORM; buffer

      - *(buffer([shape],dist))*: Buffer the geometry (`[shape]`)
        using `dist` pixels as buffer distance. For polygons, a
        negative `dist` will produce a setback.

      .. index::

      .. index::
         triple: LAYER; GEOMTRANSFORM; simplifypt

      - *(simplifypt([shape], tolerance))*: simplifies a geometry
        (`[shape]`), ensuring that the result is a valid geometry
        having the same dimension and number of components as the
        input. `tolerance` must be non-negative.

      .. index::
         triple: LAYER; GEOMTRANSFORM; generalize

      - *(generalize([shape],tolerance))*: simplifies a geometry
        (`[shape]`) in way comparable to FME's ThinNoPoint
        algorithm. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/966 for more
        information.

      .. index::

        .. seealso::

           :ref:`geomtransform` and :ref:`shape_smoothing`

      There is a difference between STYLE and LAYER
      GEOMTRANSFORM. LAYER-level will receive ground coordinates
      (meters, degress, etc) and STYLE-level will receive pixel
      coordinates. The argument to methods such as simplify() must be
      in the same units as the coordinates of the shapes at that point
      of the rendering workflow, i.e. pixels at the STYLE-level and in
      ground units at the LAYER-level.

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LAYER NAME "my_layer"
            TYPE LINE
            STATUS DEFAULT
            DATA "lines.shp"
            GEOMTRANSFORM (simplify([shape], 10))  ## 10 ground units
            CLASS
                STYLE
                    GEOMTRANSFORM (buffer([shape], 5)  ## 5 pixels
                    WIDTH 2
                    COLOR 255 0 0
                END
            END
        END

      The [map_cellsize] variable is available if you need to pass a pixel value
      at the LAYER-level.

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        LAYER NAME "my_layer"
            TYPE LINE
            STATUS DEFAULT
            DATA "lines.shp"
            UNITS meters
            # 10 * [map_cellsize] == 10 pixels converted to ground units
            GEOMTRANSFORM (simplify([shape], [map_cellsize]*10))
        ...

      To get this variable working in the math expression parser,
      the [map_cellsize] has to be converted into the layer ground unit.
      If you choose to use [map_cellsize] in your GEOMTRANSFORM expression,
      you must explicitly set the UNITS option in the layer.

LABELREQUIRES [expression]
    Sets context for labeling this layer, for example:

    .. code-block:: mapfile

        LABELREQUIRES "![orthoquads]"

    means that this layer would NOT be labeled if a layer named
    "orthoquads" is on. The expression consists of a boolean expression based
    on the status of other layers, each [layer name] substring is replaced by
    a 0 or a 1 depending on that layer's STATUS_ and then evaluated as normal.
    Logical operators AND and OR can be used.

PLUGIN [filename]
    Additional library to load by MapServer, for this layer.  This is commonly
    used to load specific support for SDE and Microsoft SQL Server layers,
    such as:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

        CONNECTIONTYPE PLUGIN
        CONNECTION "hostname,port:xxx,database,username,password"

PROCESSING [string]
    Passes a processing directive to be used with this layer. The supported
    processing directives vary by layer type, and the underlying driver that
    processes them.


    .. index::
       triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; ArcSDE options

    - **ArcSDE Directives** - All ArcSDE processing options are described
      in :ref:`arcsde`.  Here are two examples.

      .. code-block:: mapfile

          PROCESSING "QUERYORDER=ATTRIBUTE"
          PROCESSING "OBJECTID=OBJECTID"

    .. index::
       triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; ITEMS

    - **Attributes Directive** - The ITEMS processing option allows to
      specify the name of attributes for inline layers or specify the subset
      of the attributes to be used by the layer, such as:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

    .. index::
       triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; CLOSE_CONNECTION

    - **Connection Pooling Directive** - This is where you can enable
      connection pooling for certain layer layer types. Connection pooling
      will allow MapServer to share the handle to an open database or layer
      connection throughout a single map draw process. Additionally, if you
      have FastCGI enabled, the connection handle will stay open indefinitely,
      or according to the options specified in the
      :ref:`FastCGI <fastcgi>` configuration. :ref:`oci`, :ref:`arcsde`,
      :ref:`ogr` and :ref:`input_postgis` currently support this approach.
      "**DEFER**" enables connection pooling; "**ALWAYS**" will always close 
      the connection after use, and will also not try to reuse a shared 
      connection from the pool that might come from another layer.

    - **Kernel density radius** - Radius in pixels of the gaussian
      filter to apply to the bitmap array once all features have been
      accumulated.  Higher values result in increased cpu time needed
      to compute the filtered data.

    .. index::
       triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; KERNELDENSITY_COMPUTE_BORDERS

    - **Kernel density compute borders** - A kernel of radius "r"
      cannot be applied to "r" pixels along the borders of the image.
      The default is to extend the search rectangle of the input
      datasource to include features "r" pixels outside of the current
      map extent so that the computed heatmap extends to the full
      extent of the resulting image.  This can be deactivated when
      tiling if the tiling software applies a metabuffer of "r" pixels
      to its requests, to avoid the performance overhead of computing
      this extra information.

      .. code-block:: mapfile

          PROCESSING "KERNELDENSITY_COMPUTE_BORDERS=ON|OFF"

      .. versionadded:: 7.0

    .. index::
       triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; KERNELDENSITY_NORMALIZATION

    - **Kernel density normalization**- If set to "AUTO", the created
      raster band will be scaled such that its intensities range from
      0 to 255, in order to fully span the configured color ramp.
      Such behavior may not be desirable (typically for tiling) as the
      resulting intensity of a pixel at a given location will vary
      depending on the extent of the current map request.  If set to a
      numeric value, the samples will be multiplied by the given value.
      It is up to the user to determine which scaling value to use to
      make the resulting pixels span the full 0-255 range; determining
      that value is mostly a process of trial and error.  Pixels that
      fall outside the 0-255 range will be clipped to 0 or 255.

    - **Raster colour ramping** - RANGE_COLORSPACE=RGB|HSL - The
      default RANGE support interpolates colors between stops in RGB
      space, which usually results in washed out colors. The
      interpolation can be done in HSL space which usually results in
      wanted output for heatmaps.

      used to skip clipping of shapes when determining associated
      label anchor points. This avoids changes in label position as
      extents change between map draws. It also avoids duplicate

    - **Line Rendering Directive** - The POLYLINE_NO_CLIP processing
      option can be used to skip clipping of shapes when rendering
      styled lines (dashed or styled with symbols).  This avoids
      changes in the line styling as extents change between map
      draws. It also avoids edge effects where features appear in
      multiple adjacent tiles when creating tiled maps.

      spacing is the distance, in pixels, between arrows to be
      displayed in the vector field.  Default is 32.  UV_SIZE_SCALE:
      Used to convert the vector lengths (magnitude) of the raster to
      pixels for a better rendering. Default is 1.

    - **AGG renderer tweaking** - This directive can be used for setting
      the linear gamma to be used when rendering polygon features. The
      default value of 0.75 (that can be overridden at the :ref:`outputformat`
      level) can be set to a lower value to limit/remove the faint outlines
      that appear between adjacent polygons. A value of 0.5 is usually good

    - **Union layer Directives** - The following processing options
      can be used with the union layers: UNION_STATUS_CHECK (TRUE or
      FALSE) - controls whether the status of the source layes should
      be checked and the invisible layers (STATUS=OFF) should be
      skipped. Default value is FALSE.  UNION_SCALE_CHECK (TRUE or
      FALSE) - controls whether the scale range of the source layes
      should be checked and the invisible layers (falling outside of
      the scale range and zoom range) should be skipped. Default value
      is TRUE.  UNION_SRCLAYER_CLOSE_CONNECTION - override the
      connection pool setting of the source layers. By introducing
      this setting we alter the current behaviour which is equivalent
      to: "UNION_SRCLAYER_CLOSE_CONNECTION=ALWAYS"

        In :ref:`CGI <cgi>` mode, layers with STATUS DEFAULT cannot be turned
        off using normal mechanisms. It is recommended to set layers to STATUS

    - *<attribute>*: Item to use for feature specific styling. The
      style information may be represented by a separate attribute
      (style string) attached to the feature.  MapServer supports the
      following style string representations:

      - **MapServer STYLE definition** - The style string can be
        represented as a MapServer :ref:`STYLE` block according to the
        following example:

        .. code-block:: mapfile

          STYLE BACKGROUNDCOLOR 128 0 0 COLOR 0 0 208 END

      - **MapServer CLASS definition** - By specifying the entire
        :ref:`CLASS` instead of a single style allows to use further
        options (like setting expressions, label attributes, multiple
        styles) on a per feature basis.

      - **OGR Style String** - MapServer support rendering the OGR
        style string format according to the `OGR - Feature Style
        Specification`_ documentation.  Currently only a few data
        sources support storing the styles along with the features
        (like MapInfo, AutoCAD DXF, Microstation DGN), however those
        styles can easily be transferred to many other data sources as
        a separate attribute by using the `ogr2ogr`_ command line tool
        as follows:

        .. code-block:: bash

          ogr2ogr -sql "select *, OGR_STYLE from srclayer" "dstlayer" "srclayer"

    .. index::
       triple: LAYER; STYLEITEM; AUTO

    - *AUTO*: The value: `AUTO` can be used for automatic styling.

      - Automatic styling can be provided by the driver. Currently,
        only the OGR driver supports automatic styling.

      - When used for a :ref:`union`, the styles from the source
        layers will be used.

SYMBOLSCALEDENOM [double]
    The scale at which symbols and/or text appear full size. This
    allows for dynamic scaling of objects based on the scale of the
    map. If not set then this layer will always appear at the same
    size. Scaling only takes place within the limits of MINSIZE and
    MAXSIZE as described above.  Scale is given as the denominator of
    the actual scale fraction, for example for a map at a scale of
    1:24,000 use 24000.  Implemented in MapServer 5.0, to replace the

   pair: LAYER; TILEINDEX

.. _TILEINDEX_keyword:

:ref:`TILEINDEX <tileindex>` [filename|layername]
    Name of the tileindex file or layer.  A tileindex is similar to
    an ArcInfo library index.  The tileindex contains polygon features for
    each tile. The item that contains the location of the tiled data is given
    using the TILEITEM parameter.  When a file is used as the tileindex for
    shapefile or raster layers, the tileindex should be a shapefile.  For
    CONNECTIONTYPE OGR layers, any OGR supported datasource can be a
    tileindex.  Normally the location should contain the path to the tile
    file relative to the shapepath, not relative to the tileindex itself.
    If the DATA parameter contains a value then it is added to the end of
    the location.  When a tileindex layer is used, it works similarly to
    directly referring to a file, but any supported feature source can
    be used (ie. postgres, oracle).

    .. note::

        All files in the tileindex should have the same coordinate system, and
        for vector files the same set of attributes in the same order.

    .. note::

        Starting with MapServer 6.4 for raster layers and MapServer 7.2 for
        vector layers, tileindexes with tiles of different projections can be
        used. For that, the :ref:`TILESRS <tilesrs>` parameter must be specified.

    That SRS can be expressed in WKT format, as an EPSG:XXXX code or as a
    PROJ.4 string.
    If the tileindex contains rasters in different projections, this option
    must be specified. If the tileindex has been generated with
    gdaltindex (GDAL >= 2.0) or ogrtindex (GDAL >= 2.2), the value of TILESRS
    is the value of the -src_srs_name option of gdaltindex/ogrtindex.
    See :ref:`tileindex_mixed_srs`

    .. note::

        This option is currently available only on raster layers.

.. index::
   pair: LAYER; TOLERANCE

.. _TOLERANCE:

TOLERANCE [double]
    Sensitivity for point based queries (i.e. via mouse and/or map
    coordinates). Given in TOLERANCEUNITS. If the layer is a POINT or a LINE,
    the default is 3. For all other layer types, the default is 0.  To
    restrict polygon searches so that the point must occur in the polygon
    set the tolerance to zero. This setting does not apply to WFS GetFeature
    operations.

.. index::
   pair: LAYER; TOLERANCEUNITS

TOLERANCEUNITS [pixels|feet|inches|kilometers|meters|miles|nauticalmiles|dd]
    Units of the TOLERANCE value. Default is pixels.
    `Nauticalmiles` was added in MapServer 5.6.

TRANSPARENCY [integer|alpha] - deprecated

    .. deprecated:: 5.0
       Use OPACITY_ instead.

    .. deprecated:: 7.0
       Use :ref:`COMPOSITE` instead.

.. index::
   pair: LAYER; TRANSFORM

TRANSFORM [true|false] | [ul|uc|ur|cl|cc|cr|ll|lc|lr]
    Tells MapServer whether or not a particular layer needs to be transformed
    from some coordinate system to image coordinates. Default is true. This
    allows you to create shapefiles in image/graphics coordinates and
    therefore have features that will always be displayed in the same location
    on every map. Ideal for placing logos or text in maps. Remember that the
    graphics coordinate system has an origin in the upper left hand corner of
    the image, contrary to most map coordinate systems.

    Version 4.10 introduces the ability to define features with coordinates
    given in pixels (or percentages, see UNITS), most often inline features,
    relative to something other than the UL corner of an image. That is what
    'TRANSFORM FALSE' means. By setting an alternative origin it allows you
    to anchor something like a copyright statement to another portion of the
    image in a way that is independent of image size.

   triple: LAYER; TYPE; query

TYPE [chart|circle|line|point|polygon|raster|query]
    Specifies how the data should be drawn. Need not be the same as the
    shapefile type. For example, a polygon shapefile may be drawn as a point
    layer, but a point shapefile may not be drawn as a polygon layer. Common
    sense rules.

    In order to differentiate between POLYGONs and POLYLINEs (which do not
    exist as a type), simply respectively use or omit the COLOR keyword when
    classifying. If you use it, it's a polygon with a fill color, otherwise
    it's a polyline with only an OUTLINECOLOR.

    A `circle` must be defined by a a minimum bounding rectangle. That
    is, two points that define the smallest square that can contain
    it. These two points are the two opposite corners of said box.
    The following is an example using inline points to draw a circle:

    .. code-block:: mapfile

      LAYER
        NAME 'inline_circles'
        TYPE CIRCLE
        STATUS ON
        FEATURE
          POINTS
            74.01 -53.8
            110.7 -22.16
          END
        END
        CLASS
          STYLE
            COLOR 0 0 255
          END
        END
      END

    `TYPE` `query` means the layer can be queried but not drawn.

    .. note::

      `TYPE` `annotation` has been deprecated since version 6.2.
      Identical functionality can be obtained by adding :ref:`LABEL`
      level :ref:`STYLE` blocks, and do not require loading the
      datasets twice in two different layers as was the case with
      layers of `TYPE` `annotation`.

       `chart`.

UNITS [dd|feet|inches|kilometers|meters|miles|nauticalmiles|percentages|pixels]
    Units of the layer.  `percentages` (in this case a value between 0
    and 1) was added in MapServer 4.10 and is mostly geared for inline
    features.  `nauticalmiles` was added in MapServer 5.6.

.. index::
   pair: LAYER; UTFDATA

UTFDATA [string]
    A UTFGrid JSON template.  MapServer expression syntax
    (expressionObj).  If no `UTFDATA` is provided, no data beyond the
    `UTFITEM` values will be exposed.  If `UTFITEM` is set, the
    `UTFDATA` expose those so that keys and data can be connected.
    See :ref:`rfc93` and :ref:`utfgrid_output`.

    .. code-block:: mapfile

       UTFDATA "{\"id\":\"[fid]\", \"name\":\"[name]\", \"area\":\"[area]\"}"

    .. versionadded:: 7.0

.. index::
   pair: LAYER; UTFITEM

UTFITEM [string]
    The attribute to use as the ID for the UTFGrid.  If a `UTFITEM` is
    not set, the sequential id (based on rendering order) is being
    used.  If `UTFITEM` is set, the `UTFDATA` expose those so that
    keys and data can be connected.  See :ref:`rfc93` and
    :ref:`utfgrid_output`.

    .. code-block:: mapfile

        UTFITEM "fid"

    .. versionadded:: 7.0

.. index::
   pair: LAYER; VALIDATION

:ref:`VALIDATION`
    Signals the start of a :ref:`VALIDATION` block.

    As of MapServer 5.4.0, `VALIDATION` blocks are the preferred
    mechanism for specifying validation patterns for CGI param runtime
    substitutions.  See :ref:`RUNSUB`.
