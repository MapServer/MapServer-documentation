DEBUG [on|off]
    Enables debugging of the class object. Verbose output is generated
    and sent to the standard error output (STDERR) or the MapServer
    logfile if one is set using the `LOG` parameter in the :ref:`WEB`
    object.

   pair: CLASS; EXPRESSION
   :name: mapfile-class-expression
    
EXPRESSION [string]
    Four types of expressions are now supported to define which class
    a feature belongs to: String comparisons, regular expressions,
    logical expressions, and string functions (see
    :ref:`EXPRESSIONS`).  If no expression is given, then all features
    are said to belong to this class.

    - String comparisons are case sensitive and are the fastest to
      evaluate.  No special delimiters are necessary although strings
      must be quoted if they contain special characters. (As a matter
      of good habit, it is recommended that you quote all strings).
      The attribute to use for comparison is defined in the
      :ref:`LAYER` `CLASSITEM` parameter.
      
    - Regular expression are limited using slashes (/regex/). The
      attribute to use for comparison is defined in the :ref:`LAYER`
      `CLASSITEM` parameter.

    - Logical expressions allow the building of fairly complex tests
      based on one or more attributes.  Logical expressions are delimited by
      parentheses "(expression)".  Attribute names are delimited by
      square brackets "[ATTRIBUTE]".  Attribute names are case
      sensitive and must match the items in the shapefile.  For
      example:

      .. code-block:: mapfile

         EXPRESSION ([POPULATION] > 50000 AND '[LANGUAGE]' eq 'FRENCH')

      The following logical operators are supported: =, >, <, <=, >=,
      =, or, and, lt, gt, ge, le, eq, ne, in, ~, ~\*.  As one might
      expect, this level of complexity is slower to process.

    - One string function exists: length(). It computes the length
      of a string:

      .. code-block:: mapfile
        
         EXPRESSION (length('[NAME_E]') < 8)                      
                                
    String comparisons and regular expressions work from the classitem
    defined at the layer level. You may mix expression types within
    the different classes of a layer.

.. index::
   pair: CLASS; GROUP
   :name: mapfile-class-group
    
GROUP [string]
    Allows for grouping of classes.  It is only used when a
    `CLASSGROUP` at the :ref:`LAYER` level is set. If the `CLASSGROUP`
    parameter is set, only classes that have the same group name would
    be considered at rendering time.  An example of a layer with
    grouped classes might contain:

    .. code-block:: mapfile

      LAYER
        ...
        CLASSGROUP "group1"
        ...
        CLASS
          NAME "name1"
          GROUP "group1"
          ...
        END
        CLASS
          NAME "name2"
          GROUP "group2"
          ...
        END
        CLASS
          NAME "name3"
          GROUP "group1"
          ...
        END
        ...

    map at a scale of 1:24,000 use 24000. Implemented in MapServer
    5.0, to replace the deprecated `MAXSCALE` parameter.

.. index::
   pair: CLASS; TEXT
   :name: mapfile-class-text
    
TEXT [string|expression]
    Text to label features in this class with. This overrides values
    obtained from the :ref:`layer` `LABELITEM`.  The string can
    contain references to feature attributes.  This allows you to
    concatenate multiple attributes into a single label.  You can for
    example concatenate the attributes FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME like
    this::

       TEXT '[FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME]'

    More advanced :ref:`EXPRESSIONS` can be used to specify the
    labels.  Since version 6.0, there are functions available for
    formatting numbers::

      TEXT ("Area is: " + tostring([area],"%.2f"))

    mechanism for specifying validation patterns for CGI param runtime
    substitutions.  See :ref:`RUNSUB`.
