 SYMBOL
*****************************************************************************

- Symbol definitions can be included within the main map file or, more
  commonly, in a separate file. Symbol definitions in a separate file
  are designated using the :ref:`SYMBOLSET <SYMBOLSET>` keyword, as
  part of the :ref:`MAP object <map>`.  This recommended setup is
  ideal for re-using symbol definitions across multiple MapServer
  applications.
- There are 3 main types of symbols in MapServer: Markers, 
  Lines and Shadesets.
- Symbol 0 is always the degenerate case for a particular class of 
  symbol. For points, symbol 0 is a single pixel, for shading (i.e. 
  filled polygons) symbol 0 is a solid fill, and for lines, symbol 0 
  is a single pixel wide line.
- Symbol definitions contain no color information, colors are set within 
  :ref:`STYLE` objects.
- For MapServer versions < 5 there is a maximum of 64 symbols per
  file. This can be changed by editing mapsymbol.h and changing the
  value of MS_MAXSYMBOLS at the top of the file.  As of MapServer 5.0
  there is no symbol limit.
- More information can be found in the
  :ref:`Construction of Cartographic Symbols <sym_construction>`
  document.


.. index::
    pair: ANTIALIAS; SYMBOL
    
ANTIALIAS [true|false]
    Should TrueType fonts be antialiased.  Only useful for GD (gif)
    rendering.  Default is false.  Has no effect for the other
    renderers (where anti-aliasing can not be turned off).

CHARACTER [char]
    Character used to reference a particular TrueType font character. 
    You'll need to figure out the mapping from the keyboard character 
    to font character.

FILLED [true|false]
    Sets the symbol to be filled with a user defined color (See the
    :ref:`STYLE` object). For marker symbols, if `OUTLINECOLOR` was
    specified then the symbol is outlined with it.

FONT [string]
    Name of TrueType font to use as defined in the :ref:`FONTSET`.


GAP [int]
    This keyword has been moved to :ref:`STYLE` in version 6.0.
    
    .. deprecated:: 6.0

IMAGE [string]
    Image (GIF or PNG) to use as a marker or brush for type `pixmap`
    symbols.

NAME [string]
    Alias for the symbol.  To be used in :ref:`CLASS` :ref:`STYLE`
    objects.

LINECAP [butt|round|square|triangle]
    This keyword has been moved to :ref:`STYLE` in version 6.0.

    .. deprecated:: 6.0

LINEJOIN [round|miter|bevel]
    This keyword has been moved to :ref:`STYLE` in version 6.0.
    
    .. deprecated:: 6.0

LINEJOINMAXSIZE [int]
    This keyword has been moved to :ref:`STYLE` in version 6.0.
    
    .. deprecated:: 6.0

PATTERN [num on] [num off] [num on] ... END
    This keyword has been moved to :ref:`STYLE` in version 6.0.

    .. deprecated:: 6.0

POINTS [x y] [x y] ... END

    Signifies the start of a sequence of points that make up a symbol
    of `TYPE` `vector` or that define the x and y radius of a symbol
    of `TYPE` `ellipse`.  The end of this section is signified with
    the keyword `END`.  The `x` and `y` values can be given using
    decimal numbers.  The maximum `x` and `y` values define the
    bounding box of the symbol.  The size (actually height) of a
    symbol is defined in the :ref:`STYLE`.  You can create
    non-contiguous paths by inserting "-99 -99" at the appropriate
    places.

    x values increase to the right, y values increase downwards.

    For symbols of `TYPE` `ellipse`, a single point is specified that
    defines the x and y radius of the ellipse. Circles are created
    when `x` and `y` are equal.

    .. note::

      If a :ref:`STYLE` using this symbol doesn't contain an explicit
      size, then the default symbol size will be based on the range of
      "y" values in the point coordinates. e.g. if the y coordinates
      of the points in the symbol range from 0 to 5, then the default
      size for this symbol will be assumed to be 5.

STYLE [num on] [num off] [num on] ... END
    Renamed to `PATTERN` in MapServer 5.0.
    
    .. deprecated:: 5.0

TRANSPARENT [color index]
    Sets a transparent color for the input image for pixmap symbols,
    or determines whether all shade symbols should have a transparent
    background.  For shade symbols it may be desirable to have
    background features "show through" a transparent hatching pattern,
    creating a more complex map.  By default a symbol's background is
    the same as the parent image (i.e.  color 0). This is user
    configurable.

    .. note::

      The default (AGG) renderer does not support the `TRANSPARENT`
      parameter. It is supported by the GD renderer (GIF).

TYPE [ellipse|hatch|pixmap|simple|truetype|vector]
    -  `ellipse`: radius values in the x and y directions define an ellipse.
    -  `hatch`: produces hatched lines throughout the (polygon) shape.
    -  `pixmap`: a user supplied image will be used as the symbol.
    -  `simple`: default symbol type (1 pixel point, 1 pixel line, solid
       fill).
    -  `truetype`: TrueType font to use as defined in the :ref:`MAP`
       :ref:`FONTSET`\.
    -  `vector`: a vector drawing is used to define the shape of the symbol.
