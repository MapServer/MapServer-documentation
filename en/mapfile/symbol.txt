*****************************************************************************
 SYMBOL
*****************************************************************************

- Symbol definitions can be included within the main map file or, more
  commonly, in a separate file. Symbol definitions in a separate file
  are designated using the :ref:`SYMBOLSET <SYMBOLSET>` keyword, as
  part of the :ref:`MAP object <map>`.  This recommended setup is
  ideal for re-using symbol definitions across multiple MapServer
  applications.
- There are 3 main types of symbols in MapServer: Markers, 
  Lines and Shadesets.
- Symbol 0 is always the degenerate case for a particular class of 
  symbol. For points, symbol 0 is a single pixel, for shading (i.e. 
  filled polygons) symbol 0 is a solid fill, and for lines, symbol 0 
  is a single pixel wide line.
- Symbol definitions contain no color information, colors are set within 
  :ref:`STYLE` objects.
- Line styling was moved to :ref:`CLASS` :ref:`STYLE` in MapServer 
  version 5.  The mechanisms are no longer available in `SYMBOL`.
- For MapServer versions < 5 there is a maximum of 64 symbols per
  file. This can be changed by editing mapsymbol.h and changing the
  value of MS_MAXSYMBOLS at the top of the file.  As of MapServer 5.0
  there is no symbol limit.
- More information can be found in the
  :ref:`Construction of Cartographic Symbols <sym_construction>`
  document.


.. index::
   pair: SYMBOL; ANCHORPOINT
   :name: mapfile-symbol-anchorpoint
    
ANCHORPOINT [x] [y]
    .. versionadded:: 6.2

    Used to specify the location (within the symbol) that is to be
    used as an anchorpoint when rotating the symbol and placing the
    symbol on a map.  Default is **0.5 0.5** (corresponding to the
    center of the symbol).

      `x`: A double in the range [0,1] that specifies the location
      within the symbol along the x axis.  0 specifies the left edge
      of the symbol, 1 specifies the right edge of the symbol.  0.5
      specifies the center of the symbol (in the x direction).

      `y`: A double in the range [0,1] that specifies the location
      within the symbol along the y axis.  0 specifies the top edge of
      the symbol, 1 specifies the lower edge of the symbol.  0.5
      specifies the center of the symbol (in the y direction).

    `ANCHORPOINT` can be used with `SYMBOL`\s of `TYPE` `ellipse`,
    `pixmap`, `svg`, `truetype` and `vector`.  To ensure proper
    behaviour for vector symbols, the left and top edges of the
    bounding box of the symbol should be at 0.
    
    .. note::
        SVG symbols might require to have their width/height set inside the
        SVG file, for ANCHORPOINT to work correctly.  See
        `report <https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/mapserver-users/2021-February/082025.html>`__.

   pair: SYMBOL; ANTIALIAS
   :name: mapfile-symbol-antialias
    
ANTIALIAS [true|false]
    Should TrueType fonts be antialiased.  Only useful for GD (gif)
    rendering.  Default is false.  Has no effect for the other
    renderers (where anti-aliasing can not be turned off).

    .. warning::

       GD support was removed in MapServer 7.0.

.. index::
   pair: SYMBOL; CHARACTER
   :name: mapfile-symbol-character
    
CHARACTER [char|entity number]
    Character used to reference a particular TrueType font character. 
    You'll need to figure out the mapping from the keyboard character 
    to font character.
    
    HTML entity numbers can also be used, for example:
    
    .. code-block:: mapfile

        SYMBOL
          NAME "right-arrow"
          COLOR 255 255 255
          TYPE TRUETYPE
          FONT "dejavu"
          CHARACTER "&#10140;"
        END

.. index::
   pair: SYMBOL; FILLED
   :name: mapfile-symbol-filled
    
FILLED [true|false]
    If `true`, the symbol will be filled with a user defined color
    (using :ref:`STYLE` `COLOR`).  Default is `false`.

    If `true`, symbols of `TYPE` `ellipse` and `vector` will be
    treated as polygons (fill color specified using :ref:`style`
    `COLOR` and outline specified using :ref:`style` `OUTLINECOLOR`
    and `WIDTH`).

    If `false`, symbols of `TYPE` `ellipse` and `vector` will be
    treated as lines (the lines can be given a color using
    :ref:`style` `COLOR` and a width using :ref:`style` `WIDTH`).

.. index::
   pair: SYMBOL; FONT
   :name: mapfile-symbol-font
    
FONT [string]
    Name of TrueType font to use as defined in the :ref:`FONTSET`.

.. index::
   pair: SYMBOL; IMAGE
   :name: mapfile-symbol-image
    
IMAGE [string]
    Filename of image to use as a marker. For type `pixmap`, use
    GIF or PNG files; for type `svg`, use SVG.

.. index::
   pair: SYMBOL; NAME
   :name: mapfile-symbol-name
    
NAME [string]
    Alias for the symbol.  To be used in :ref:`CLASS` :ref:`STYLE`
    objects.

.. index::
   pair: SYMBOL; POINTS
   :name: mapfile-symbol-points
    
POINTS [x y] [x y] ... END

    Signifies the start of a sequence of points that make up a symbol
    of `TYPE` `vector` or that define the x and y radius of a symbol
    of `TYPE` `ellipse`.  The end of this section is signified with
    the keyword `END`.  The `x` and `y` values can be given using
    decimal numbers.  The maximum `x` and `y` values define the
    bounding box of the symbol.  The size (actually height) of a
    symbol is defined in the :ref:`STYLE`.  You can create
    non-contiguous paths by inserting "-99 -99" at the appropriate
    places.

    x values increase to the right, y values increase downwards.

    For symbols of `TYPE` `ellipse`, a single point is specified that
    defines the x and y radius of the ellipse. Circles are created
    when `x` and `y` are equal.

    .. note::

      If a :ref:`STYLE` using this symbol doesn't contain an explicit
      size, then the default symbol size will be based on the range of
      "y" values in the point coordinates. e.g. if the y coordinates
      of the points in the symbol range from 0 to 5, then the default
      size for this symbol will be assumed to be 5.

.. index::
   pair: SYMBOL; TRANSPARENT
   :name: mapfile-symbol-transparent
    
TRANSPARENT [color index]
    Sets a transparent color for the input image for pixmap symbols,
    or determines whether all shade symbols should have a transparent
    background.  For shade symbols it may be desirable to have
    background features "show through" a transparent hatching pattern,
    creating a more complex map.  By default a symbol's background is
    the same as the parent image (i.e.  color 0). This is user
    configurable.

    .. note::

      The default (AGG) renderer does not support the `TRANSPARENT`
      parameter. It is supported by the GD renderer (GIF).

    .. warning::

       GD support was removed in MapServer 7.0.

TYPE [ellipse|hatch|pixmap|svg|truetype|vector]
    -  `ellipse`: radius values in the x and y directions define an ellipse.
    -  `hatch`: produces hatched lines throughout the (polygon) shape.
    -  `pixmap`: a user supplied image will be used as the symbol.
    -  `svg`: scalable vector graphics (SVG) symbol.  Requires the
       libsvg/libsvg-cairo libraries (or alternatively the librsvg library).
    -  `truetype`: TrueType font to use as defined in the :ref:`MAP`
       :ref:`FONTSET`\.
    -  `vector`: a vector drawing is used to define the shape of the symbol.

    .. note::

      .. index::
         triple: SYMBOL; TYPE; cartoline
    
      `TYPE` `cartoline` is no longer used.  Dashed lines are
      specified using `PATTERN`, `LINECAP`, `LINEJOIN` and
      `LINEJOINMAXSIZE` in :ref:`STYLE`.  Examples in
      :ref:`Construction of Cartographic Symbols <sym_construction>`.
