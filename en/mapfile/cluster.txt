Description
===========

Since version 6.0, MapServer has the ability to combine multiple
features from a point layer into single (aggregated) features based on
their relative positions.
Only *POINT* layers are supported.
This feature was added through :ref:`rfc69`.

Supported Layer Types
=====================

POINT

Mapfile Parameters
==================

.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; MAXDISTANCE
    
MAXDISTANCE [double]
    Specifies the distance of the search region (rectangle or ellipse)
    in pixel positions.
  
.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; REGION
    
REGION [string]
    Defines the search region around a feature in which the
    neighbouring features are negotiated.
    Can be 'rectangle' or 'ellipse'.
    
.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; GROUP
    
:ref:`GROUP <expressions>` [string]
    This expression evaluates to a string and only the features that
    have the same group value are negotiated. This parameter can be
    omitted. The evaluated group value is available in the
    'Cluster:Group' feature attribute.
    
.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; FILTER
    
:ref:`FILTER <expressions>` [string]
    We can define the FILTER expression filter some of the features
    from the final output.  This expression evaluates to a boolean
    value and if this value is false the corresponding shape is
    filtered out.  This expression is evaluated after the the feature
    negotiation is completed, therefore the 'Cluster:FeatureCount'
    parameter can also be used, which provides the option to filter
    the shapes having too many or to few neighbors within the search
    region.
    
Mapfile Snippet
===============

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LAYER
    NAME "my-cluster"
    TYPE POINT
    ...
    CLUSTER
       MAXDISTANCE 20  # in pixels
       REGION ellipse  # can be rectangle or ellipse
       GROUP (expression)  # we can define an expression to create separate groups for each value
       FILTER (expression) # we can define a logical expression to specify the grouping condition
    END
    LABELITEM "Cluster:FeatureCount"    
    CLASS
      ...
      LABEL
       ...
      END
    END

   pair: CLUSTER; feature attributes

Feature attributes
==================

The clustered layer itself provides the following aggregated attributes: 

.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; FeatureCount

.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; Group

1. Cluster:FeatureCount - count of the features in the clustered shape 
2. Cluster:Group - The group value of the cluster (to which the group
   expression is evaluated)

These attributes (in addition to the attributes provided by the
original data source) can be used to configure the labels of the
features and can also be used in expressions.  The ITEMS processing
option can be used to specify a subset of the attributes from the
original layer in the query operations according to the user's
preference.

.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; Aggregate functions

We can use simple aggregate functions (Min, Max, Sum, Count) to
specify how the clustered attribute should be calculated from the
original attributes. The aggregate function should be specified as a
prefix separated by ':' in the attibute definition, like:
[Max:itemname]. If we don't specify aggregate functions for the source
layer attributes, then the actual value of the cluster attribute will
be non-deterministic if the cluster contains multiple shapes with
different values. The Count aggregate function in fact provides the
same value as Cluster:FeatureCount.

PHP MapScript Usage
===================

The :ref:`CLUSTER object <phpclusterobj>` is exposed through PHP
MapScript.  An example follows:

.. code-block:: php

  $map = ms_newMapobj("/var/www/vhosts/mysite/httpdocs/test.map");
  $layer1=$map->getLayerByName("test1");
  $layer1->cluster; 

Example: Clustering Railway Stations
====================================

The following example uses a point datasource, in this case in KML
format, to display clusters of railway stations.  Two classes are
used: one to style and label the cluster, and one to style and label
the single railway station.

.. note::
    Since we can't declare 2 labelitems, for the single railway class
    we use the *TEXT* parameter to label the station.
