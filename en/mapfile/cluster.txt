Description
===========

Since version 6.0, MapServer has the ability to combine multiple
features from a point layer into single (aggregated) features based on
their relative positions.
Only *POINT* layers are supported.
This feature was added through :ref:`rfc69`.

Supported Layer Types
=====================

Only layers of `TYPE POINT` are supported. 

Mapfile Parameters
==================

.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; MAXDISTANCE
   :name: mapfile-cluster-maxdistance
    
MAXDISTANCE [double]
    Specifies the distance of the search region (rectangle or ellipse)
    in pixel positions.
  
.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; REGION
   :name: mapfile-cluster-region
    
REGION [string]
    Defines the search region around a feature in which the
    neighbouring features are negotiated.
    Can be 'rectangle' or 'ellipse'.
    
.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; BUFFER
   :name: mapfile-cluster-buffer
    
BUFFER [double]
    Defines a buffer region around the map extent in pixels. Default is 0.
    Using a buffer allows that the neighbouring shapes around the map 
    are also considered during the cluster creation.
   
.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; GROUP
   :name: mapfile-cluster-group
    
:ref:`GROUP <expressions>` [string]
    This expression evaluates to a string and only the features that
    have the same group value are negotiated. This parameter can be
    omitted. The evaluated group value is available in the
    'Cluster_Group' feature attribute.
    
.. index::
   pair: CLUSTER; FILTER
   :name: mapfile-cluster-filter
    
:ref:`FILTER <expressions>` [string]
    We can define the FILTER expression filter some of the features
    from the final output.  This expression evaluates to a boolean
    value and if this value is false the corresponding shape is
    filtered out.  This expression is evaluated after the the feature
    negotiation is completed, therefore the 'Cluster_FeatureCount'
    parameter can also be used, which provides the option to filter
    the shapes having too many or to few neighbors within the search
    region.

Supported Processing Options
============================

The following processing options can be used with the cluster layers:

.. index::
   triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; CLUSTER_GET_ALL_SHAPES

CLUSTER_GET_ALL_SHAPES=ON
    Return all shapes contained by a cluster instead of a single shape.
    This setting affects both the drawing and the query processing (especially
    useful for GetFeatureInfo requests).  Example 
    usage: `PROCESSING "CLUSTER_GET_ALL_SHAPES=ON"`
    
.. index::
   triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; CLUSTER_KEEP_LOCATIONS    
    
CLUSTER_KEEP_LOCATIONS=ON
    Set whether the location of the cluster shape should be preserved (setting
    this will show all points in the cluster). Example 
    usage: `PROCESSING "CLUSTER_KEEP_LOCATIONS=ON"`
    
CLUSTER_ALGORITHM=SIMPLE
    From MapServer 6.2 we can choose a more simplified clustering algorithm
    which performs better that the original (more accurate) approach.
    usage: `PROCESSING "CLUSTER_ALGORITHM=SIMPLE"`

Bug 5503_
 
.. _5503: https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues/5503
    
.. index::
   triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; CLUSTER_USE_MAP_UNITS     
    
CLUSTER_USE_MAP_UNITS=ON
    Provide scale independent clustering (maxdistance and the buffer parameters are 
    specified in map units). Example usage: `PROCESSING "CLUSTER_USE_MAP_UNITS=ON"`   
    
.. index::
   triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; ITEMS   
    
ITEMS
    Specify the feature attributes in the cluster to expose during a query, separated
    by a comma. Example usage: `PROCESSING "ITEMS=attribute_x,attribute_y,attribute_z"`    
      
Mapfile Snippet
===============

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LAYER
    NAME "my-cluster"
    TYPE POINT
    ...
    CLUSTER
       MAXDISTANCE 20  # in pixels
       REGION "ellipse"  # can be rectangle or ellipse
       GROUP (expression)  # an expression to create separate groups for each value
       FILTER (expression) # a logical expression to specify the grouping condition
    END
    LABELITEM "Cluster_FeatureCount"    
    CLASS
      ...
      LABEL
       ...
      END
    END
    ...
  END
  

.. index::
   pair: Cluster; Feature attributes

Feature attributes
==================

The clustered layer itself provides the following aggregated attributes: 

.. index::
   pair: Cluster; FeatureCount

.. index::
   pair: Cluster; Group

1. Cluster_FeatureCount - count of the features in the clustered shape 
2. Cluster_Group - The group value of the cluster (to which the group
   expression is evaluated)
   
 .. note::
   If you are using MapServer version 6.x these attributes contain a ":" 
   in their names instead, such as `Cluster:FeatureCount` & `Cluster:Group`.
   The "_" was changed in MapServer 7.

These attributes (in addition to the attributes provided by the
original data source) can be used to configure the labels of the
features and can also be used in expressions.  The ITEMS processing
option can be used to specify a subset of the attributes from the
original layer in the query operations according to the user's
preference.

.. index::
   pair: Cluster; Aggregate functions

We can use simple aggregate functions (Min, Max, Sum, Count) to
specify how the clustered attribute should be calculated from the
original attributes. The aggregate function should be specified as a
prefix separated by ':' in the attribute definition, like:
[Max:itemname]. If we don't specify aggregate functions for the source
layer attributes, then the actual value of the cluster attribute will
be non-deterministic if the cluster contains multiple shapes with
different values. The Count aggregate function in fact provides the
same value as Cluster_FeatureCount.
  
Handling GetFeatureInfo
=======================

If you want to allow WMS GetFeatureInfo on all features inside a cluster,
you must 1) set the "wms_include_items" metadata as usual, and 2) set the following 
PROCESSING parameters in the layer:

::

  PROCESSING "CLUSTER_GET_ALL_SHAPES=ON"
  PROCESSING "ITEMS=attribute_x,attribute_y,attribute_z"
  
So your layer might look like the following:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LAYER
    NAME "my-cluster"
    TYPE POINT
    METADATA
      "wms_title"    "myttitle"
      "wms_include_items" "all"                 
    END    
    ...
    CLUSTER
       ...
    END
    LABELITEM "Cluster_FeatureCount"    
    CLASS
      ...
      LABEL
       ...
      END
    END
    ...
    PROCESSING "CLUSTER_GET_ALL_SHAPES=ON"           
    PROCESSING "ITEMS=name,description"      
  END

PHP MapScript Usage
===================

The :ref:`CLUSTER object <phpclusterobj>` is exposed through PHP
MapScript.  An example follows:

.. code-block:: php

  $map = ms_newMapobj("/var/www/vhosts/mysite/httpdocs/test.map");
  $layer1=$map->getLayerByName("test1");
  $layer1->cluster; 

Example: Clustering Railway Stations
====================================

The following example uses a point datasource, in this case in KML
format, to display clusters of railway stations.  Two classes are
used: one to style and label the cluster, and one to style and label
the single railway station.

.. note::
    Since we can't declare 2 labelitems, for the single railway class
    we use the *TEXT* parameter to label the station.
