Shape Smoothing
=========================================================================

1. Overview
-----------

MapServer can smooth a vector layer for a better rendering result using
the SIA algorithm: Smoothing via Iterative Averaging.

2. How it works
------------------------

To enable the smoothing for a layer with the default settings, we only need 
to set the geomtransform:

 * GEOMTRANSFORM (smoothsia([shape]))

Smoothing settings:

 * smoothing_size: The window size (number of points) used by the algorithm. The
   default is 3.
 * smoothing_iteration: The number of iterations of the algorithm. The default
   is 1.
 * preprocessing: Optional preprocessing method to add more vertices to the shape prior to smoothing, described below.

You can pass those optional parameters using the following geomtransform:

 * GEOMTRANSFORM (smoothsia([shape], [smoothing_size], [smoothing_iteration], [preprocessing]))

Example of a simple layer definition:

::

  LAYER NAME "my_layer"
    TYPE LINE
    STATUS DEFAULT
    DATA roads.shp
    GEOMTRANSFORM (smoothsia([shape], 3, 1))    
    CLASS
      STYLE
        WIDTH 2
        COLOR 255 0 0
      END
    END

3. Examples

Here are some examples showing results with different parameter values.

4. Smoothing result factors
---------------------------

Since the smoothing algorithm is performed on a window of x vertices (3 by 
default), there are some factors that might affect the result.

4.1 Dataset resolution is too high
----------------------------------

If you are trying to smooth a line that has a very high resolution (high 
density of vertices at the current view scale), you may not get the expected 
result because the vertices are too dense for the smoothing window size. 
In this case you might want to simplify the shapes before the smoothing. 
You can combine smoothing and simplification in a single geomtransform for that.

 * GEOMTRANSFORM (smoothsia(simplifypt([shape], 10))) 

See :ref:`RFC 89: Layer Geomtransform <rfc89>` for more info. Here's a
visualization of the issue:

4.2 Dataset resolution is too low
---------------------------------

If you are trying to smooth a long line that has a low density of
vertices, you may not get the expected result in some situations where
you may lose some important parts of the shape during the smoothing,
for instance around acute angles. You can improve the result by
enabling a pre-processing step to add intermediate vertices along the
line prior to smoothing. 

This behavior is controlled using the "all" value in the preprocessing
argument of the smoothsia() geomtransform:

 * GEOMTRANSFORM (smoothsia([shape], [smoothing_size], [smoothing_iteration], 'all'))

This preprocessing will be performed before the smoothing. It adds 2
intermediate vertices on each side of each original vertex. This is
useful if we really need to preserve the general shape of the shape
with low res data. Note that this might have an impact on the
rendering since there are more vertices in the output.

Here's a visualization of the issue:

4.3 Curves
----------

The preprocessing step might not be appropriate for all cases since it can
impact a lot the smoothing result (maybe too much?). However, without it, you
might notice some bad smoothing with big curves. See this example:

 .. image:: ../images/smoothing_curve1.png


You can improve that by enabling another type of preprocessing: angle. This one
will add points at some specific places based on angle detection to recognize
the curves. Here's how you can enable it:

 * GEOMTRANSFORM (smoothsia([shape], [smoothing_size], [smoothing_iteration], 'angle'))
