Introduction
============

UTFGrid is a new output who will soon be released. This howto details the new functionalities
that this adds to map creation. This howto assumes you already now the basics of mapfile 
syntax. If not, you should probably be reading :ref:`the mapfile syntax <mapfile>`.

Functionnality
==============

UTFGrid output will allow greater interactions with maps by allowing data to be exposed via an
invisible UTF-8 characters grid.

Build
=====

* Iconv is necessary for the UTFGrid driver.
* AGG driver is also necessary for this driver.

Setting the OutputFormat
========================

This added in the mapfile will allow mapserver to use the UTFGrid output. In this 
case, the output generated will be a grid with each pixels corresponding to a 4x4 
pixels square in the original image. Also, it won't allow duplicates which means different
shapes with the same IDs will be considered as a single shape.

.. code-block:: mapfile

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "utfgrid"
    DRIVER UTFGRID
    MIMETYPE "application/json"
    EXTENSION "json"
    FORMATOPTION "UTFRESOLUTION=4"
    FORMATOPTION "DUPLICATES=false"
  END

If no FORMATOPTIONs are set, defaults values will be used. Defaults values 
are: 4 for UTFRESOLUTION, true for DUPLICATES.

Exposing Feature Properties
===========================

To use UTFGrid, two new LAYER items were added. These two items allow the user
to choose which data will be exposed. To use them, add these to your layer in the
mapfile.

Exemple:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  UTFITEM   "id"
  UTFDATA   "{\"id\":\"[id]\",\"name\":\"[name]\"}"
 
Both items can be used separetly. If a UTFITEM is not set the sequential 
id(based on rendering order) will be used as the grid keys. Using the UTFITEM won't
duplicates. If no UTFDATA is set no data beyond the UTFITEM will be exposed.

Notes
======

* UTFGrids can be set on multiple layers but only one UTFGrid can be rendered at a time. If 
  you wish to add multiples UTFGrid, with for example OpenLayers, you need to add new layer
  for each of them.
* Due to upcoming changes to text rendering UTFGrid driver doesn't support Truetype
  symbols rendering and will ignore them.
