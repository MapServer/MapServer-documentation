Introduction
============

UTFGrid is an output format that was added in MapServer version 7.
This howto assumes that you have basic knowledge of the mapfile
syntax (see :ref:`mapfile`).

Functionality
==============

UTFGrid output will allow more interaction with maps by allowing data
to be exposed via an invisible UTF-8 character grid.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`rfc93`

Build
=====

* Iconv is required.
* AGG is required.

Setting the OutputFormat
========================

Adding the following to the mapfile will allow mapserver to use
generate UTFGrid output.  For this example, the output generated will
be a grid with each pixel corresponding to a 4x4 pixels square in the
original image.  Also, it will not allow duplicates which means
different shapes with the same IDs will be considered as a single
shape.

.. code-block:: mapfile

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "utfgrid"
    DRIVER UTFGRID
    MIMETYPE "application/json"
    EXTENSION "json"
    FORMATOPTION "UTFRESOLUTION=4"
    FORMATOPTION "DUPLICATES=false"
  END

If no FORMATOPTION is set, default values will be used. Default values
are: *4* for UTFRESOLUTION and *true* for DUPLICATES.

Exposing Feature Properties
===========================

Two `LAYER` parameters are used to choose which data to expose.  To
use them, add these to your `LAYER` in the mapfile.

.. code-block:: mapfile

  UTFITEM   "id"
  UTFDATA   "{\"id\":\"[id]\",\"name\":\"[name]\"}"
 
The items can be used separately.  If `UTFITEM` is not set, a sequence
number (based on the rendering order) will be used as the grid ID.  If
`UTFDATA` is not set, no data beyond the `UTFITEM` will be exposed.

.. note:: 

   UTFGrids can be set on multiple layers, but only one UTFGrid can be
   rendered at a time. If you wish to add multiples UTFGrids, with for
   example OpenLayers, you need to add a new layer for each of them.

.. note::

   Due to upcoming changes in text rendering the UTFGrid driver doesn't
   support Truetype symbol rendering.
