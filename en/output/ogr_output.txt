Introduction
============

OGR output support was added to MapServer 6.0.  It provides an output driver
to produce feature style output suitable as a return result from WMS 
GetFeatureInfo or WFS GetFeature requests.  OGR feature output depends on
MapServer being built against the GDAL/OGR library.  The OGR output driver 
should be enabled in MapServer 6.0 or newer when INPUT=OGR appears in the 
version string. 

OUTPUTFORMAT Declarations
=========================

Details of OGR output formats allowed are controlled by an :ref:`OUTPUTFORMAT`
declaration.  The declarations define the OGR format driver to be used, 
creation options specific to that driver, and more general instructions to
MapServer on how to package multi-file results and whether to try and 
build the result on disk or in memory.

Examples:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "CSV"
    DRIVER "OGR/CSV"
    MIMETYPE "text/csv"
    FORMATOPTION "LCO:GEOMETRY=AS_WKT"
    FORMATOPTION "STORAGE=memory"
    FORMATOPTION "FORM=simple"
    FORMATOPTION "FILENAME=result.csv"
  END

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "OGRGML"
    DRIVER "OGR/GML"
    FORMATOPTION "STORAGE=filesystem"
    FORMATOPTION "FORM=multipart"
    FORMATOPTION "FILENAME=result.gml"
  END

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "SHAPEZIP"
    DRIVER "OGR/ESRI Shapefile"
    FORMATOPTION "STORAGE=memory"
    FORMATOPTION "FORM=zip"
    FORMATOPTION "FILENAME=result.zip"
  END

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "SPATIALITEZIP"
    DRIVER "OGR/SQLITE"
    MIMETYPE "application/zip"
    FORMATOPTION "DSCO:SPATIALITE=YES"
    FORMATOPTION "STORAGE=memory"
    FORMATOPTION "FORM=zip"
    FORMATOPTION "FILENAME=result.db.zip"
  END

The OGR format driver to be used is determined by the name appearing 
after "OGR/" in the DRIVER argument.  This name should match one of 
the formats listed as supported for the "-f" argument to ogr2ogr in the
ogr2ogr usage message.  

The IMAGEMODE for OGR output is FEATURE, but this is implicit and does
not need to be explicitly stated for OGR output driver declarations.

The OGR renderer will support the following FORMATOPTION declarations:

**DSCO:\***
  Anything prefixed by DSCO: is used as a dataset creation option with the
  OGR driver. See the OGR web page for the particular format driver to see
  layer creation options available.

**LCO:\*** 
  Anything prefixed by LCO: is used as a layer creation option.  See
  the OGR web page for the particular format driver to see layer creation
  options available.w

**FORM=simple/zip/multipart**
  Indicates whether the result should be a simple single file (simple), a
  mime multipart attachment (multipart) or a zip file (zip).  "zip" is
  the default.

**STORAGE=memory/filesystem/stream**
  Indicates where the datasource should be stored while being written. 
  "filesystem" is the default.

  If "memory" then it will be created in /vsimem/ - but this is only suitable
  for drivers supporting VSI*L which we can't easily determine automatically.

  If "filesystem", then a directory for temporary files (specified
  using :ref:`WEB` `TEMPPATH` or `MS_TEMPPATH`) will be used for
  writing and reading back the file(s) to stream to the client.

  If "stream" then the datasource will be created with a name "/vsistdout"
  as an attempt to write directly to stdout.  Only a few OGR drivers will 
  work properly in this mode (ie. CSV, perhaps kml, gml). 

**FILENAME=name**
  Provides a name for the datasource created, default is "result.dat" for single
  file or multipart form, or "result.zip" for zip form.
  In the case of zip form, the filename can be of the format basename.ext.zip where
  basename.ext will be used as the actual OGR datasource name (i.e. generally
  the filename that will be put inside the zip file).

**USE_FEATUREID=true/false**
  Starting from MapServer v7.0.2. Defaults to false. Include feature ids in the generated output,
  if the ows_featureid metadata key is set at the layer level. The featureid
  column to use **should** be an integer column. Useful if you need to include
  an "id" attribute to your geojson output. Use with caution as some OGR output
  drivers may behave strangely when fed with *random* FIDs.

LAYER Metadata
==============

The OGR output driver utilizes several items from the LAYER level METADATA
object.  Some of these were originally intended for GML output or are 
primarily intended to support WFS.


**wfs_getfeature_formatlist**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of formats supported for WFS GetFeature 
  responses.  The OUTPUTFORMAT NAME values should be listed.

  ::

    "wfs_getfeature_formatlist" "OGRGML,SHAPEZIP,CSV"

**wfs_additional_files_in_output**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of filenames that should be included as
  additional files in the response to a WFS GetFeature request for this layer,
  for output formats whose FORM FORMATOPTION is "zip" or "multipart". This is typically
  used to add technical information, metadata or licensing information.
  The filenames can also be directory names, in which case all the files contained
  in the directory will be taken into account.
  Relative filenames will be evaluated against the mapfile directory, and the
  SHAPEPATH value if defined.
  Filenames can also be URLs (starting with http:// or https://). For that latter
  capability, note that this requires OGR to be compiled with Curl support.
  ::

    "wfs_additional_files_in_output" "license.pdf,my_layer_metadata.xml"


**gml_include_items**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of items to include, or keyword
  "all".  You can enable full exposure by using the keyword "all".  
  
  ::

    "gml_include_items" "all"
    
  You can specify a list of attributes (fields) for partial exposure, such as:
  
  ::

    "gml_include_items" "Name,ID"
    
  The new default behaviour is to expose no attributes at all.

**gml_[item name]_alias**
  (Optional) An alias for an attribute's name.  The resulting file will refer
  to this attribute by the alias.  Here is an example:

  ::
  
    "gml_province_alias" "prov"
    
**gml_[item name]_type**
  (Optional) Specifies the type of the attribute.  Valid values
  are Integer|Long|Real|Character|Date|Time|DateTime|Boolean. 

  .. note::
    Long is to be used for 64-bit integers, starting with MapServer 7.0.1.
    If MapServer is built against GDAL 2.0 or later, Long will be translated as a
    OGR 64-bit integer. For earlier versions, it will be translated as a OGR
    double-precision floating point value.

  .. note::
    Time and DateTime have been added in MapServer 8. And since MapServer 8,
    Date semantics is a date, without time, whereas in previous versions, it
    was used indifferently for Date, Time or DateTime.

**gml_[item name]_width**
  (Optional) Specifies the width of the indicated field for formats where
  this is significant, such as Shapefiles. 

**gml_[item name]_precision**
  (Optional) Specifies the precision of the indicated field for formats where
  this is significant, such as Shapefiles.  Precision is the number of decimal
  places, and is only needed for "Real" fields.

**gml_types**
  (Optional) If this field is "auto" then some input feature drivers (ie. 
  OGR, and native shapefiles) will automatically populate the type, width and
  precision metadata for the layer based on the source file. 

  ::

    "gml_types"   "auto"

**ows/wfs_geomtype**
  (Optional, metadata shared with :ref:`WFS server GML output <wfs_server>`)
  Set the geometry type of OGR layers created from this MapServer
  LAYER.  One of "Point", "LineString", "Polygon", "MultiPoint", 
  "MultiLineString", "MultiPolygon", "GeometryCollection", "Geometry", 
  or "None".  Most are fairly obvious, but "Geometry" can be used to represent
  a mix of geometry types, and "None" is sometimes suitable for layers without
  geometry.  Note that layers which are a mix of polygon and multipolygon 
  would normally have to be described as "Geometry".  To produce 2.5D output
  append "25D" to the geometry type (ie. "Polygon25D").   Note that Z values
  are only carried by MapServer if built with USE_POINT_Z_M support.

  ::

    "ows_geomtype"  "Polygon"


MAP / WEB Metadata
==================

**wms_feature_info_mime_type**
  In order for WMS GetFeatureInfo to allow selection of OGR output formats, 
  the mime type associated with the OUTPUTFORMAT must be listed in this metadata
  item.

  ::
 
    "wms_feature_info_mime_type" "text/csv"

**wfs_additional_files_in_output**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of filenames that should be included as
  additional files in the response to a WFS GetFeature request, for any layer of
  the mapfile, for output formats whose FORM FORMATOPTION is "zip" or "multipart". This is typically
  used to add technical information, metadata or licensing information.
  The filenames can also be directory names, in which case all the files contained
  in the directory will be taken into account.
  Relative filenames will be evaluated against the mapfile directory, and the
  SHAPEPATH value if defined.
  Filenames can also be URLs (starting with http:// or https://). For that latter
  capability, note that this requires OGR to be compiled with Curl support.

  ::

    "wfs_additional_files_in_output" "license.pdf"

Geometry Types Supported
========================

In MapServer we have POINT, LINE and POLYGON layers which also allow for 
features with multiple points, lines or polygons.  However, in the OGC Simple 
Feature geometry model used by OGR a point and multipoint layer are quite 
distinct.  Likewise for a LineString and MultiLineString and Polygon an 
MultiPolygon layer type. 

To work around the mismatches between the MapServer and OGR geometry models,
there is a mechanism to specify the geometry type to be used when exporting
through OGR.  This is the "wfs/ows_geomtype" metadata item on the layer. It
may be one of one of "Point", "LineString", "Polygon", "MultiPoint", 
"MultiLineString", "MultiPolygon", "GeometryCollection", "Geometry", or "None".

If this item is not specified, then "Point", "LineString" or "Polygon" will
be used depending on the TYPE of the LAYER.   In cases of mixed geometry
types (ie. polygons and multipolygons) the geometry type should be set to 
"Geometry" which means any geometry type. 

  ::

    "ows_geomtype" "Geometry"

In order 2.5D support (geometries with Z coordinates) to be enabled, the "25D"
suffix must be add to the value of the "ows_geomtype" metadata item
(i.e. "Polygon25D"), and MapServer must be built with USE_POINT_Z_M support.

.. note::
   Empty geometries are supported from the MapServer 8.0 release. 
  
Empty or null geometries can also be output through OGR. When using the GeoJSON
format these are returned as ``"geometry": null``. The CSV format outputs them as
an empty value. 

To ensure empty features are not removed by a spatial filter use the following setting in
the LAYER METADATA:
    
  :: 
  
    "wfs_use_default_extent_for_getfeature" "false"

Attribute Field Definitions
===========================

For OGR output it is highly desirable to be able to create the output fields 
with the appropriate datatype, width and precision to reflect the source 
feature definition. 

It is possible to set the gml_[item]_type, gml_[item]_width and 
gml_[item]_precision metadata on the layer to provide detailed field 
definitions::

    METADATA
      "gml_ID_type"        "Integer"
      "gml_ID_width"       "8"
      "gml_AREA_type"      "Real"
      "gml_AREA_width"     "15"
      "gml_AREA_precision" "6"
      "gml_NAME_type"      "Character"
      "gml_NAME_width"     "64"
      ...

However, doing this manually is tedious and error prone.  For that reason
some feature sources (at least OGR, Shapefiles, POSTGIS and ORACLESPATIAL) 
support a mechanism to automatically populate this information from the 
source datastore.  To accomplish this specify::

    "gml_types"            "auto"

If no effort is made to set type, width and precision information for
attribute fields, they will all be treated as variable length character
fields when writing through OGR.

Return Packaging
================

One of the challenges returning generalized feature formats is that
many such formats consists of multiple files which must be returned in 
the result.  There are three approaches taken to this based on the 
FORM FORMATOPTION in the OUTPUTFORMAT declaration. 

**simple**
  In this case a single result is returned.  This is suitable for format
  drivers that produce a single file.  The return result will have the 
  mimetype listed in the OUTPUTFORMAT declaration.  Note that if the OGR
  driver actually returns multiple files, only the primary one (the one
  with a name matching the filename passed into the OGR CreateDataSource call)
  will be returned.  The return result will have a suggested filename based
  on the FILENAME FORMATOPTION.

**multipart**
  In this case all the files produced are returned as a multipart mime
  result.  In this case the MIMETYPE of the OUTPUTFORMAT is ignored.  All
  component files are returned with a mime type of "application/binary" and
  the whole package is "multipart/mixed".  

**zip**
  In this case all the files produced are bundled into one .zip file and
  this zip file is returned with a mimetype of "application/zip".   The
  OUTPUTFORMAT MIMETYPE is ignored.

One caveat with "zip" results is that this option is only available if 
the GDAL/OGR version is 1.8 or newer (or a 1.8 development later than 
approximately Oct 15, 2010).  Earlier versions of GDAL/OGR lacked the
zipping capability needed.

Test Suite Example
==================

The MSAutoTest test suite contains a test case for use of OGR Output from
WFS.   The mapfile is at:

  https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/blob/main/msautotest/wxs/wfs_ogr.map

The comments at the start of the file have a variety of sample requests 
that can be run against the map, as long as [MAPFILE] is replaced with the
mapfile name.  They requests should be run against mapserv sitting in the
msautotest/wxs directory.
