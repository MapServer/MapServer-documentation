Introduction
============

Microsoft SQL Server 2008+ supports storing spatial data by using the
built-in geometry/geography data types. MapServer can connect to MSSQL through either: 
1) an OGR connectiontype, or 2) a driver that accesses these tables containing spatial 
columns, which is compiled as a plugin ("msplugin_mssql2008.dll").

Creating Spatial Data Tables in MSSQL 2008
==========================================

There are several ways to create spatial data tables in MSSQL
2008. You can easily upload existing data to an MSSQL
table by using the `ogr2ogr <http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr>`__
commandline tool and the OGR's `MSSQL Spatial driver
<http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_mssqlspatial.html>`__  Here is an example that uploads 
a shapefile (province.shp) into an MSSQL 2008 instance:

::

  ogr2ogr -f MSSQLSpatial -a_srs EPSG:4326 "MSSQL:server=.\SQLEXPRESS;database=geo;trusted_connection=yes" province.shp

Connecting to Spatial Data in MSSQL 2008
========================================

In order to connect to the MSSQL 2008 spatial database you should set
up a valid connection string to the database like the following
examples:

::

  Server=.\MSSQLSERVER2008;Database=Maps;Integrated Security=true

::

  Server=55.55.55.55,1433;uid=a_user;pwd=a_password;database=a_database;
         Integrated Security=True

::

  Server=55.55.55.55\SQLEXPRESS,1433;uid=a_user;pwd=a_password;
         database=a_database;Integrated Security=True
  
OPTION 1: Connect Through OGR
-----------------------------

GDAL/OGR (and therefore MapServer) can read spatial tables in MSSQL 2008 through the 
`MSSQLSpatial driver <http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_mssqlspatial.html>`__.

Verify Local Support for MSSQLSpatial
*************************************

Use the command "ogrinfo --formats" to verify that your local GDAL is built with support for MSSQL; 
the response should contain "MSSQLSpatial" such as:

::

  Supported Formats:
    -> "OCI" (read/write)
    -> "ESRI Shapefile" (read/write)
    -> "MapInfo File" (read/write)
    ...
    -> "MSSQLSpatial" (read/write)
    ...
    
Test OGR Connection Parameters
******************************

Use the ogrinfo commandline utility to test your connection through the MSSQLSpatial driver, such as:

::

  ogrinfo "MSSQL:server=.\SQLEXPRESS;database=geo;trusted_connection=yes" province -summary
  
Create MapServer Layer using CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
***********************************************

Your layer should contain a CONNECTIONTYPE OGR statement, as well as a CONNECTION.
The connection should also contact a "tables=" parameter, and also the name of the
geometry column in brackets.  You do not need to specify the DATA parameter unless you 
define an sql select statement starting with the 'WHERE' keyword.  For example:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LAYER
    NAME "provinces"
    TYPE POLYGON
    STATUS ON
    ####
    CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
    CONNECTION "MSSQL:server=.\SQLEXPRESS;uid=xx;pwd=xxx;database=geo;trusted_connection=yes;tables=province(ogr_geometry)"
    ####
    PROJECTION
      "init=epsg:4326"
    END
    CLASS
      NAME "Land"
      STYLE
        COLOR 240 240 240
        OUTLINECOLOR 199 199 199
      END
    END
    PROCESSING 'CLOSE_CONNECTION=DEFER'
  END # layer
  

.. NOTE::
   The usual CONNECTIONTYPE terms 'using unique' and 'using srid' are not meaningful 
   for the OGR driver in this case, as these parameters are automatically retrieved 
   from the 'geometry_columns' metadata table.

OPTION 2: Connect Through MapServer Plugin
------------------------------------------

Create MapServer Layer
**********************

Once the connection can be established to the server the layer can be
configured to access MSSQL2008 as follows:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  LAYER
    NAME "rivers_mssql_spatial"
    TYPE POLYGON
    STATUS DEFAULT
    CONNECTIONTYPE PLUGIN
    PLUGIN "msplugin_mssql2008.dll"
    CONNECTION "Server=.\MSSQLSERVER2008;Database=Maps;Integrated Security=true"
    DATA "ogr_geometry from rivers USING UNIQUE ogr_fid USING SRID=4326"
    ...
  END 

The DATA parameter is used to perform the SQL select statement to
access your table in MSSQL.  The geometry column is required in the
select statement; in the above example the ogr_geometry column is the
geometry column in the rivers table. The table should also have an
unique column (ogr_fid) which is provided for random access to the
features in the feature query operations.

The DATA section should also contain the spatial reference id (SRID)
of the features in the data table The SRID is used when specifying the
search shapes during the intersect operations which should match with
the SRID of the features otherwise no features are returned in a
particular query.  if you omit specifying the SRID value in the DATA
section the diver will use SRID=0 when defining the search shapes.

Selecting the Type of the Geometry Column
*****************************************

For the geometry columns MSSQL supports 2 data types: "geometry" and
"geography".  By default the driver considers the type of the geometry
column is "geometry".  In case if the type of the geometry column is
"geography" we must specify the data type in the DATA section
explicitly, like::

  DATA "ogr_geometry(geography) from rivers USING UNIQUE ogr_fid USING SRID=4326"

Expected Location of the MSSQL Plugin
*************************************

On Windows platforms the DLLs needed by the program are searched for
in the following order:

1) The directory from which the application loaded.
   
2) The current directory.

3) The system directory. Use the `GetSystemDirectory
   <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724373.aspx>`__ function
   to get the path of this directory.
   
4) The 16-bit system directory.

5) The Windows directory. Use the `GetWindowsDirectory
   <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724454.aspx>`__ function
   to get the path of this directory.
   
6) The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

Binaries Containing the MSSQL Plugin
************************************

Currently the following binary distributions contain
msplugin_mssql2008.dll:

- `GISInternals <http://www.gisinternals.com>`__
- `MS4W distributions <http://www.ms4w.com>`__

Using Spatial Indexes
---------------------

In order to speed up the access to the features a spatial index should
be created to the geometry column which could easily be done with the
OGR MSSQL Spatial driver like::

  ogrinfo -sql "create spatial index on rivers"
               "MSSQL:server=.\MSSQLSERVER2008;database=Maps;
                Integrated Security=true"
  
In general we can safely rely on the query optimizer to select the
most appropriate index in the sql query operations. In some cases -
however - we should force the optimizer to use the spatial index by
specifying the index hint in the DATA section like::

  DATA "ogr_geometry from rivers using index ogr_geometry_sidx
        USING UNIQUE ogr_fid USING SRID=4326"

Layer Processing Options
------------------------

We can control the behaviour of the MSSQL driver by using the
following PROCESSING options:

.. index::
   triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; CLOSE_CONNECTION

- **CLOSE_CONNECTION=DEFER** - This is where you can enable connection
  pooling for certain layer types. Connection pooling will allow
  MapServer to share the handle to an open database or layer
  connection throughout a single map draw process.
      
.. index::
   triple: LAYER; PROCESSING; MSSQL_READ_WKB

- **MSSQL_READ_WKB=TRUE** - Uses WKB (Well Known Binary) format
  instead of native format when fetching geometries.
