GeoPackage, also written as "GPKG", is a standards-based wrapper for the 
file-based SQLite database.  GPKG is an encoding standard adopted by the Open 
Geospatial Consortium back in 2014, and has since gained popularity for 
distributing both vector & raster data, inside one compact file.

More Information
----------------

More information about GPKG is available at:

* Official page: http://www.geopackage.org/
* OGC's GeoPackage Encoding Standard: https://www.ogc.org/standards/geopackage

File listing
--------------

Similar to other database formats, the *.gpkg* file consists of
several tables.  The geometry is held in a BLOB table column.

.. note::

    Windows users who want to follow along, can convert `MS4W <https://ms4w.com>`__'s 
    included *demo.db* SpatiaLite database into a GPKG file (for the *countries* 
    table) with the command (executed inside */ms4w/apps/local-demo/data/*) : ::
    
      ogr2ogr -f GPKG countries.gpkg demo.db countries

Data Access / Connection Method
---------------------------------

GPKG access is available in MapServer through OGR's `GPKG driver <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/gpkg.html>`__.  
It is recommended to use GDAL/OGR version 2.2 or later for GPKG access.

OGR uses the names of spatial tables within the GPKG database
(tables with a geometry column that are registered in the
geometry_columns table) as layers.

The CONNECTION parameter must include the *.gpkg* extension, and the
DATA parameter should be the name of the spatial table (or OGR layer).

.. code-block:: mapfile

  CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
  CONNECTION "name.gpkg"
  DATA "layername"
  
.. tip::

    The MapServer 7.4.x series contained a few critical fixes for GPKG 
    access, therefore at the minimum, at least MapServer 7.6.0 is 
    recommended.    
    
Step 1: Use ogrinfo to examine
------------------------------

First you should make sure that your local GDAL/OGR build contains both the
"GPKG" driver & the "SQLite / Spatialite" driver, by using the 
*--formats* command:

::

  >ogrinfo --formats
  
     Supported Formats:
          ...
          GPKG -raster,vector- (rw+vs): GeoPackage
          SQLite -vector- (rw+v): SQLite / Spatialite
          ...

Once you have confirmed that you have the GPKG driver you are ready
to try an ogrinfo command on your database to get a list of spatial
tables:

::

  >ogrinfo countries.gpkg
  
    INFO: Open of `countries.gpkg'
          using driver `GPKG' successful.
    1: countries (Multi Polygon)

Now use ogrinfo to get information on the structure of the spatial
'countries' table:

::

  >ogrinfo countries.gpkg countries -summary
  
        INFO: Open of `countries.gpkg'
              using driver `GPKG' successful.

        sov_a3: String (0.0)
        adm0_dif: Integer (0.0)
        ...


Step 2: Add the layer in your mapfile
-------------------------------------

For OGR connections, it is always recommended to set CONNECTIONTYPE,
CONNECTION, and DATA, as follows:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    /* Countries */
    LAYER
      NAME "countries"
      TYPE POLYGON
      STATUS ON
      CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
      CONNECTION "countries.gpkg"
      DATA "countries"            # the OGR layername, found through ogrinfo
      CLASS
        NAME "World Countries"
        STYLE
          COLOR 200 200 200
          OUTLINECOLOR 0 0 0
          WIDTH 0.1
        END #style 
      END #class
    END #layer
     
Step 3: Test your Mapfile with shp2img
--------------------------------------

Use the MapServer commandline utility :ref:`shp2img` to verify that your 
mapfile creates a valid map image, and also display draw times, such as:

::

  shp2img -m geopackage.map -o ttt.png -map_debug 3
  
  msDrawMap(): rendering using outputformat named png (AGG/PNG).
  msDrawMap(): WMS/WFS set-up and query, 0.000s
  msDrawMap(): Layer 0 (countries), 0.078s
  msDrawMap(): Drawing Label Cache, 0.000s
  msDrawMap() total time: 0.079s
  msSaveImage(ttt.png) total time: 0.008s
