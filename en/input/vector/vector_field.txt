*****************************************************************************
 Vector field rendering - UVraster
*****************************************************************************

Added in MapServer 6.2, Vector fields are used for instance in meteorology to 
store/display wind direction and magnitude.

.. seealso:: :ref:`rfc78`


The source is two bands of raster data, the first band represents the
U component of the vector, and the second band the V component.  Using
the u,v values at a given location we can compute a rotation and
magnitude and use that to draw an arrow of a size proportional to the
magnitude and pointing in the direction of the phenomenon (wind,
current, etc.)

For more details about vector fields, refer to: `Vector field`_

LAYER Description
-----------------

A vector field :ref:`LAYER` is a hybrid layer, which has a raster data
source as input and vector features as output.  The output features
are represented as points.  Queries are not supported.

Since the data source is a raster, all raster processing options can
be used (e.g. RESAMPLE).  RESAMPLE=AVERAGE generally gives a good
result, and the default.  This can be overridden by explicitly
specifying the type of resampling.

Vector field layers are of `TYPE` `point`, and have `CONNECTIONTYPE`
`uvraster`.  The raster data set is specified in `DATA`.  The two
bands that define the vector field are specified using `PROCESSING`
`BANDS` (U first, V second).

LAYER Attributes
----------------

The UVraster connection type offers the following attributes:

* [u]: the raw u value
* [v]: the raw v value
* [uv_angle]: the vector angle
* [uv_minus_angle]: the vector angle - opposite direction
* [uv_length]: the vector length (scaled with the `UV_SIZE_SCALE`
  optional value)
* [uv_length_2]: half the vector length

Optional `PROCESSING` Settings
------------------------------

* `UV_SPACING`: The spacing is simply the distance, in pixels, between
  arrows to be displayed in the vector field. Default is 32.
* `UV_SIZE_SCALE`: The uv size scale is used to convert the vector
  lengths (magnitude) of the raster to pixels for a better
  rendering. Default is 1.
