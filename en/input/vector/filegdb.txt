 ESRI File Geodatabase
*****************************************************************************

ESRI File Geodatabases exist in a file folder and offer improved performance and size limitations.  For more information see the ESRI `description page`_.

.. _`description page`: https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geodatabases/types-of-geodatabases.htm 

.. note::
   Only file geodatabases created by AcrGIS 10.0 and above can be read by GDAL/MapServer.

File listing
------------

File geodatabases are made up of a set of files within a folder. The files are made up of geographic data, attribute data,
index files, and lock files.  A better description of the file contents can be found `here <https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases-and-windows-explorer.htm>`__.

Data Access / Connection Method
---------------------------------

File geodatabase access is available through OGR. See the OGR driver page for `FileGDB <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/filegdb.html>`__
for specific driver information.  The driver is available for GDAL >= 1.9.0.  You may also see the
the OGR driver page for `OpenFileGDB <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/openfilegdb.html>`__ which
provides read-only access and does not require an external SDK to compile.

.. note::
   For Windows users, `MS4W <https://ms4w.com>`__ leverages the `OpenFileGDB <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/openfilegdb.html>`__ driver.

The CONNECTION parameter must be used to point to the name of the file folder, and the DATA parameter
should be the name of the spatial table (or OGR layer).

.. code-block:: mapfile

  CONNECTIONTYPE ogr
  CONNECTION "filegdb-folder"
  DATA "layername" 
  
.. note::
   The CONNECTION path is relative to the mapfile (SHAPEPATH is not used here).  Full paths can also be used.

OGRINFO Examples
----------------

First you should make sure that your GDAL/OGR build contains the file
geodatabase "FileGDB" driver (or the "OpenFileGDB" driver), by using the '--formats' command:

::

  >ogrinfo --formats
  
     Supported Formats:
     ...
     "FileGDB" (read/write)
     "ESRI Shapefile" (read/write)
     "MapInfo File" (read/write)
     "UK .NTF" (readonly)
     "SDTS" (readonly)
     "TIGER" (read/write)
     ...

If you don't have the driver, see GDAL's `BuildHints <https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FileGDB>`__ page for 
compiling the driver.

Once you have the FileGDB driver you are ready to try an ogrinfo command on your
database to get a list of spatial tables.  In the example below our folder is named `us_states.gdb`:

::

  ogrinfo us_states.gdb
  
    INFO: Open of `us_states.gdb'
    using driver `FileGDB' successful.
    1: statesp020 (Multi Polygon)

Now use ogrinfo to get information on the structure of the `statesp020` table:

::

  ogrinfo us_states.gdb statesp020 -summary
  
    INFO: Open of `us_states.gdb'
      using driver `FileGDB' successful.

    Layer name: statesp020
    Geometry: Multi Polygon
    Feature Count: 2895
    Extent: (-179.000000, 17.000000) - (179.000000, 71.000000)
    Layer SRS WKT:
    GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983",
       DATUM["North_American_Datum_1983",
           SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137.0,298.257222101]],
       PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],
       UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]]
    FID Column = OBJECTID
    Geometry Column = SHAPE
    AREA: Real (0.0)
    PERIMETER: Real (0.0)
    STATESP020: Real (0.0)
    STATE: String (0.0)
    STATE_FIPS: String (0.0)
