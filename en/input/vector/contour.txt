1. Overview
-----------

Mapserver can compute and render a contour layer on the fly from a
raster source.  The raster source is one band of raster data, which
represents a digital elevation model (DEM).  More info about DEMs at:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model

2. How it works
------------------------

.. index::
   pair: CONNECTIONTYPE; contour

CONNECTIONTYPE CONTOUR. The new type is a hybrid layer, which has a raster data
source as input and vector features as output. Initially, only the line
representation of those vector features will be supported. 

Since the internal layer is of type vector, queries will be supported and
operate on the vectors (not on the raw raster source). In the future we might
see a need to add a query mode that queries the raster source, but this is not
included in this phase of work.

To render a contour layer, we need to define a layer in the mapfile with the
following options:

 * Set the layer TYPE to LINE.
 * Set CONNECTIONTYPE to CONTOUR.
 * Set the DATA to the raster file that contains the elevation band.
 * Specify the band to use as elevation using PROCESSING "BANDS", same as
   regular raster.
 * Specify one or more classes and styles to render the line features.

PROCESSING settings:

 These options should be specified at layer level:

 * CONTOUR_INTERVAL: elevation interval between contours
 * CONTOUR_LEVELS: comma-separated list of one or more 'fixed levels' to extract
 * CONTOUR_ITEM: provides a name for the item (attribute) in which to put the
   elevation. (optional)

  You can also provide explicit min/max scaledenom in the CONTOUR_iNTERVAL or
  CONTOUR_LEVELS values if you wish to use scale-dependent contour spacing. This
  is done by adding an optional "miscaledenom,maxscaledenom:" prefix to the
  value or list of values. See the example below.

Example of a simple layer definition:

::

  LAYER NAME "my_contour_layer"
    TYPE LINE
    STATUS DEFAULT
    CONNECTIONTYPE CONTOUR
    DATA /mnt/data/raster/grib/dem.grib
    PROCESSING "BANDS=1"
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_ITEM=elevation"     
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_INTERVAL=10"
    CLASS
      STYLE
        WIDTH 2
        COLOR 255 0 0
      END
    END


Example of a layer definition with scale-dependent contour ranges:

::

  LAYER NAME "my_contour_layer"
    TYPE LINE
    STATUS DEFAULT
    CONNECTIONTYPE CONTOUR
    DATA /mnt/data/raster/grib/dem.grib
    PROCESSING "BANDS=1"
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_ITEM=elevation"     
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_INTERVAL=0,25000:5" # interval of 5 for scales of 25000 or less
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_INTERVAL=25000,500000:10" # interval of 10 for scales in the 25000 to 500000 range
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_LEVELS=500000,0:10,25,50,100" # explicit list of levels for scales of 500000 and up
    LABELITEM "elevation"
    CLASS
      STYLE
        WIDTH 2
        COLOR 255 0 0
      END
      LABEL
        ...
      END
    END

2.1 Data cellsize 
------------------

The data produced by the gdal contour algorithm are generally in high
resolution. A lot of point are used to generated contours with precision. You
might want to generalize/simplify the line in some cases (ie. Shape
Smoothing). The `[data_cellsize]` attribute binding represents the cellsize of
the extend fetched from the raster file. This is different than the map
cellsize.

In the following example, I generalize my shape with a tolerance of 25% of the
data cellsize to produce smooth contours at all scales:

::

  LAYER
    NAME "MyContourLayer"
    STATUS DEFAULT
    DATA "wind.tif"
    TYPE LINE
    CONNECTIONTYPE CONTOUR
    PROJECTION AUTO END
    PROCESSING "BANDS=1"
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_ITEM=elevation"
    PROCESSING "CONTOUR_INTERVAL=0,0:1"
    GEOMTRANSFORM (smoothsia(generalize([shape], 0.25*[data_cellsize])))    
    CLASS
      EXPRESSION ([elevation] >= 0)
      STYLE
        COLOR 0 0 255
      END # STYLE
    END # CLASS
  END # LAYER
