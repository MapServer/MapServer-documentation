Introduction
============

A WFS ( Web Feature Service ) publishes feature-level geospatial data
to the web.  This means that instead of returning an image, as
MapServer has traditionally done, the client now obtains fine-grained
information about specific geospatial features of the underlying data,
at both the geometry AND attribute levels. As with other OGC
specifications, this interface uses XML over HTTP as it's delivery
mechanism, and, more precisely, GML (Geography Markup Language), which
is a subset of XML.

In version 7.0, MapServer supports versions 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 of the WFS
specifications.

WFS-Related Information
-----------------------

Here are some WFS related links (including a newly added OGC services
workshop with MapServer). Since these are highly detailed technical
specifications, there is no need to read through them in their
entirety to get a MapServer WFS up and running. It is still
recommended however to read them over and get familiar with the basics
of each of them, in order to understand how it all works:

- The `OGC Web Feature Service Implementation Specification`_.

- The `Geography Markup Language Implementation Specification`_.

- MapServer `OGC Web Services Workshop package`_. 

For WFS 2.0, the following documents apply :

- The `OGC WFS 2.0 specification`_.

- The `OGC Filter Encoding 2.0 specification`_.

- The `OGC GML 3.2.1 specification`_.

Technical details on the implementation of WFS 2.0 in MapServer are given in
the :ref:`rfc105`.

Working knowledge of MapServer is of course also required.

Software Requirements
---------------------

In order to enable MapServer to serve WFS, it MUST be compiled against
certain libraries:

- PROJ: The reprojection library. Version 4.4.3 or greater is required.

- GDAL/OGR: I/O support libraries. Version 1.6.0 or greater is required.

Please see the MapServer :ref:`UNIX Compilation and Installation HowTo
<unix>` for detailed instructions on compiling mapserver with support
for these libraries and features.  For Windows users, the `MS4W`_
installer comes ready to serve both WFS and WMS.

   pair: WFS Server; GML

Versions of GML Supported
-------------------------

MapServer can output both GML2 and GML3.  By default MapServer serves
GML2.  You can test this by adding an 'OUTPUTFORMAT' parameter to a
GetFeature request, such as:

- `GML2 request output`_
- `GML3 request output`_

With WFS 2.0, the default OUTPUTFORMAT is "application/gml+xml; version=3.2".

For a detailed discussion on the versions supported, see `bug#884`_.

   pair: WFS Server; Mapfile

Configuring your MapFile to Serve WFS layers
============================================

Much as in the WMS support, WFS publishing is enabled by adding
certain magic METADATA keyword/value pairs to a MapFile.

MapServer will serve and include in its WFS capabilities only the
layers that meet the following conditions:

- Data source is of vector type (Shapefile, OGR, PostGIS, SDE, SDO, ...)

- LAYER NAME must be set. Layer names must start with a letter when
  setting up a WFS server (layer names should not start with a digit
  or have spaces in them).

- LAYER TYPE is one of: LINE, POINT, POLYGON

- The "wfs_onlineresource" metadata:

  The wfs_onlineresource metadata is set in the map's web object
  metadata and specifies the URL that should be used to access your
  server. This is required for the GetCapabilities output. If
  wfs_onlineresource is not provided then MapServer will try to
  provide a default one using the script name and hostname, but you
  shouldn't count on that too much. It is strongly recommended that
  you provide the wfs_onlineresource metadata.

  See section 12.3.3 of the `WFS 1.0.0 specification`_ for the whole
  story about the online resource URL. Basically, what you need is a
  complete HTTP URL including the http:// prefix, hostname, script
  name, potentially a "map=" parameter, and and terminated by "?" or
  "&".

  Here is a valid online resource URL:

  ::
  
     http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=mywfs.map&
          
  By creating a wrapper script on the server it is possible to hide
  the "map=" parameter from the URL and then your server's online
  resource URL could be something like:

  ::
  
     http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mywfs?
          
  This is covered in more detail in the "More About the Online
  Resource URL" section of the :ref:`WMS Server <online_resource_wms>`
  document.
  
  .. NOTE::
     It is strongly recommended to review the security steps for the *MAP=*
     call to the MapServer executable, by setting *MS_MAP_PATTERN* or 
     *MS_MAP_NO_PATH* or hiding the *MAP=* parameter on public servers, 
     as recommended in the document :ref:`limit_mapfile_access`. All possible
     environment variables to secure your server are listed in :ref:`environment_variables`.

- The "wfs_enable_request" metadata (see below).

   pair: WFS Server; SRS

Rules for Handling SRS in MapServer WFS
---------------------------------------

The OGC WFS 1.0 specification doesn't allow a layer (feature type)
to be advertised in more than one SRS.  Also, there is no default SRS
that applies to all layers by default.  However, it is possible to
have every layer in a WFS server advertised in a different SRS.

The OGC WFS 1.1 and 2.0 specifications allow more than one SRS to be
advertised, and one of the SRSs will be advertised as the default SRS
(the default SRS will be the first in the list specified in the
`METADATA` `wfs_srs` / `ows_srs`).

Here is how MapServer decides the SRS to advertise and use for each
layer in your WFS:

- If a top-level map SRS is defined then this SRS is used and applies
  to all layers (feature types) in this WFS. In this case the SRS of
  individual layers is simply ignored even if it is set.

- If no top-level map SRS is defined, then each layer is
  advertised in its own SRS in the capabilities.

.. note::
  By "SRS is defined", we mean either the presence of a PROJECTION
  object defined using an EPSG code, or of a `wfs_srs` / `ows_srs`
  metadata at this level.

.. note::
   At the map top-level the `wfs_srs` / `ows_srs` metadata value takes
   precedence over the contents of the :ref:`PROJECTION` block.

.. note::
   The first advertised `wfs_srs` / `ows_srs` metadata value will be used
   as the default projection of the bbox requested (unless explicitly set)
   and will be using in spatial filtering the data for those layer types 
   that support spatial filtering. If the data is in a different projection, 
   the spatial filter BBOX will be projected to match the source data.

At the layer level, if both the `wfs_srs` / `ows_srs` metadata and the
PROJECTION object are set to different values, then the `wfs_srs` /
`ows_srs` metadata defines the projection to use in advertising this
layer (assuming there is no top-level map SRS), and the PROJECTION
value is assumed to be the projection of the data. So this means that
the data would be reprojected from the PROJECTION SRS to the one
defined in the `wfs_srs` / `ows_srs` metadata before being served to
WFS clients.

Confusing? As a rule of thumb, simply set the `wfs_srs` / `ows_srs` at
the map level (in web metadata) and never set the `wfs_srs` /
`ows_srs` metadata at the layer level and things will work fine for
most cases.

Axis Orientation in WFS 1.1 and 2.0
-----------------------------------

The axis order in previous versions of the WFS specifications was to
always use easting (x or lon ) and northing (y or lat).  WFS 1.1
specifies that, depending on the particular SRS, the x axis may or may
not be oriented West-to-East, and the y axis may or may not be
oriented South-to-North. The WFS portrayal operation shall account for
axis order. This affects some of the EPSG codes that were commonly
used such as ESPG:4326.  The current implementation makes sure that
coordinates returned to the server for the GetFeature request reflect
the inverse axis orders for EPSG codes between 4000 and 5000.

Regarding SRS, for WFS 2.0, it will always be reported with the *"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::"*
syntax. This should likely also be done for WFS 1.1.0. The "wfs_return_srs_as_urn" web
metadata item can be set to "true" or "false" to enable or disable this behaviour.
It defaults to "true" for WFS 2.0 and to "false" for older versions.

Test Your WFS Server
--------------------

Validate the Capabilities Metadata
**********************************

OK, now that we've got a mapfile, we have to check the XML
capabilities returned by our server to make sure nothing is missing.

Using a web browser, access your server's online resource URL to which
you add the parameter "REQUEST=GetCapabilities" to the end, e.g.

https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

If everything went well, you should have a complete XML capabilities
document.  Search it for the word "WARNING"... MapServer inserts XML
comments starting with "<!--WARNING: " in the XML output if it detects
missing mapfile parameters or metadata items. If you notice any
warning in your XML output then you have to fix all of them before you
can register your server with a WFS client, otherwise things are
likely not going to work.

.. note::
  The SERVICE parameter is required for all WFS requests.  When a
  request happens, it is passed through WMS, WFS, and WCS in MapServer
  (in that order) until one of the services respond to it.

Test With a GetFeature Request
******************************

OK, now that we know that our server can produce a valid XML
GetCapabilities response we should test the GetFeature request. Simply
adding
"SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=yourlayername1,yourlayername2"
to your server's URL should return the GML associated with those
layers.

https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=getfeature&TYPENAME=continents&MAXFEATURES=100

For WFS 2.0, the same request would be :

https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=2.0.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAMES=continents&COUNT=100

Test with a Real Client
***********************

If you have access to a WFS client, then register your new server's
online resource with it and you should be off and running.

If you don't have your own WFS client installed already, here are a
few pointers:

- MapServer itself can be used as a WFS client, see the :ref:`WFS
  Client HowTo <wfs_client>`.

- `QGIS`_ is a full GIS package which includes WFS client
  support. (recommended)

- `Deegree`_ provides a WFS client.

- `uDig`_ can add layers from WMS/WFS servers.
  
Support for GET and POST Requests
*********************************

Starting from version 4.2 MapServer supports XML-encoded POST requests
and GET requests. The default in MapServer is POST.

Support for Filter Encoding
***************************

Starting from version 4.2 MapServer supports Filter Encoding (FE) in
WFS GetFeature requests. For more information on the server side of
Filter Encoding see the :ref:`Filter Encoding HowTo
<filter_encoding>`.

Support for Sorting
*******************

Sorting is supported for WFS 1.1 and 2.0. WFS clients can add a `SORTBY` parameter
to the query string to order results based on one or more attribute values 
e.g. `SORTBY=Field1 DESC,Field2 ASC`. 

The list of drivers that support sorting (sorting was implemented in 
MapServer 7.0 unless otherwise specified):

- OGR
- PostGIS
- Oracle
- MS SQL Server (version 7.4)

The MapServer Shapefile provider does not support sorting. If this needed, you must
use the OGR Shapefile provider. 

Further sorting implementation details can be found in :ref:`rfc105`. 

MapServer WFS Extensions
************************

.. index:: 
   pair: WFS Server; STARTINDEX

**STARTINDEX**
  This is standard in WFS 2.0, and also available as a MapServer extension for
  WFS 1.0 and 1.1.
  In addition to the MAXFEATURES=n keyword (replaced by COUNT in WFS
  2.0), MapServer also supports a STARTINDEX=n keyword in WFS
  GetFeature requests.  This can be used to skip some features in the
  result set and in combination with MAXFEATURES (or COUNT) provides
  for the ability to use WFS GetFeature to page through results.  Note
  that STARTINDEX=0 means start with the first feature, skipping none.

.. index:: 
   pair: WFS Server; OUTPUTFORMAT

**OUTPUTFORMAT**
  Normally OUTPUTFORMAT should be GML2 for WFS 1.0 and either
  "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" or "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1" for
  WFS 1.1.  For WFS 2.0, the default is "application/gml+xml; version=3.2",
  but GML2 and GML3 can also be requested.
  However as an extension to the specification, it is also
  possible to configure MapServer for a variety of other feature
  output formats.  This is discussed in some detail in the :ref:`OGR
  Output <ogr_output>` document.

.. index:: 
   pair: WFS; Metadata


.. index:: 
   pair: WFS Server; Stored queries

Stored queries (WFS 2.0)
========================

Stored queries are queries (<wfs:Query>) stored on the server,
potentially with parameters whose value can be assigned by the client
during a GetFeature request.

At WEB.METADATA level, a "wfs_storedqueries" metadata item can be
specified with a comma separated list of stored queries ids.

Then for each stored query id, "wfs_[storedqueryid]_inlinedef" must be
specified with a valid <StoredQueryDescription> as value. As it is not
always convenient to specify a inline XML content, it is also possible
to specify "wfs_{storedqueryid}_filedef" whose value is a filename
that contains the <StoredQueryDescription> XML content.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    "wfs_storedqueries"           "bboxstoredquery"
    "wfs_bboxstoredquery_filedef" "/data/bboxstoredquery.xml"

                </fes:Filter>
            </Query>
        </QueryExpressionText>
    </StoredQueryDescription>

A corresponding valid GetFeature request can be:

REQUEST=GetFeature&STOREDQUERY_ID=bboxstoredquery&LONGMIN=2&LATMIN=49&LONGMAX=3&LATMAX=50


Predefined urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById stored query
-----------------------------------------------------------------

WFS 2.0 defines a mandatory
*"urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById"* stored query.  This query
accept a ID parameter whose value must be a feature id.

A valid request is:
REQUEST=GetFeature&STOREDQUERY_ID=urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById&ID=mylayer.3

The definition hardcoded in MapServer is:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <StoredQueryDescription id="urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById">
      <Title>Get feature by identifier</Title>
      <Abstract>Returns the single feature whose value is equal to the specified value of the ID argument</Abstract>
      <Parameter name="ID" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" type="xs:string"/>
      <QueryExpressionText isPrivate="true"
            language="urn:ogc:def:queryLanguage:OGC-WFS::WFS_QueryExpression"
            returnFeatureTypes="">
        <Query xmlns:fes="http://www.opengis.net/fes/2.0" typeNames="?">
          <fes:Filter>
            <fes:ResourceId rid="${ID}"/>
          </fes:Filter>
        </Query>
      </QueryExpressionText>
    </StoredQueryDescription>

Comparing to a more standard stored query description, there are 2
oddities : The value of the "returnFeatureTypes" attribute is replaced
at runtime by the name of the valid WFS layers of the mapfile (when
issuing the response document to DescribeStoredQueries request). And
the value of the typeNames attribute is deduced at runtime from the
value of the passed ID parameter.

It is possible to override this hardcoded definition by a custom one
(for example to provide alternate values for other languages) by
defining *"wfs_urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById_inlinedef"* or
*"wfs_urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById_filedef"*.  The value of
<QueryExpressionText> attributes and child elements must however be
strictly identical to the hard-coded definition for correct execution.

A GetFeature using *"urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById"* seems to
be identical to a GetFeature with a RESOURCEID parameter, but there is
a difference. GetFeatureById returns the feature directly as the
response :

  Each of the metadata below can also be referred to as 'ows_*'
  instead of 'wfs_*'.  MapServer tries the 'wfs_*' metadata first, and
  if not found it tries the corresponding 'ows_*' name. Using this
  reduces the amount of duplication in mapfiles that support multiple
  OGC interfaces since "ows_*" metadata can be used almost everywhere
  for common metadata items shared by multiple OGC interfaces.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_compute_number_matched

**wfs_compute_number_matched**
  (Optional, WFS 2.0 only) When this metadata item is set to "true",
  the server will determine the number of features that match the
  GetFeature request and return it in the 'numberMatched' attribute of
  the <FeatureCollection> element in the response. Computing that
  number might take a very long time, so it is strongly encouraged to
  *NOT* define this item. When it is not defined, the 'numberMatched'
  attribute is set to "unknown".

  See "wfs_maxfeatures_ignore_for_resulttype_hits" for a similar setting
  affecting resultType=hits GetFeature request.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_anable_request

**wfs_enable_request** (or **ows_enable_request**)
  Space separated list of requests to enable.  The default is none.
  The following requests can be enabled: `GetCapabilities`,
  `GetFeature` and `DescribeFeatureType`.  A "!" in front of a request
  will disable the request.  "*" enables all requests.

  *Examples:*

  To enable only `GetCapabilities` and `GetFeature`:

  ::

    "wfs_enable_request" "GetCapabilities GetFeature"

  To enable all requests except `GetCapabilities`

  ::

    "wfs_enable_request" "* !GetCapabilities"

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_features_cache_count

**wfs_features_cache_count**
  (Optional, since MapServer 7.2) Maximum number of features retrieved during
  the first query pass that should be cached, so as not to be asked again to
  the datasource. This might be set to the same value as wfs_maxfeatures, but
  not necessarily. If wfs_features_cache_size is also set, the most limiting
  will be honoured.
  Note: this is an advanced setting.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_features_cache_size

**wfs_features_cache_size**
  (Optional, since MapServer 7.2) Maximum amount of RAM allowed to cache
  features during the first query pass, so as not to be asked again to
  the datasource when geneating the GML or OGR output.
  If wfs_features_cache_count   is also set, the most limiting will be honoured.
  By default the value is in bytes, unless the " MB" suffix is specified.
  Note: this is an advanced setting.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_geometry_precision

**wfs_geometry_precision**
  (Optional, since MapServer 8.0) Specifies the precision of 
  the geometry coordinates in the generated GML, where precision is 
  the number of decimal places.  This affects WFS requests using 
  the built-in GML2/GML3 output (specifying a different OUTPUTFORMAT 
  will override this setting).
  
  .. note::
    setting *wfs_geometry_precision* at the LAYER-level will override 
    any value set here in the WEB metadata.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_getcapabilities_version  

**wfs_getcapabilities_version**
  (Optional) Default version to use for GetCapabilities requests that
  do not have a version parameter.  If not set, the latest supported
  version will be returned. As of MapServer 7.0, this default version is "2.0.0".
  Valid values are "1.0.0", "1.1.0" and "2.0.0".

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_keywordlist

**wfs_languages**

- *Description:* (Optional) A comma-separated list of supported languages. For 
  details please refer to the section :ref:`inspire_dl_multi-language_support`
  in the INSPIRE Download Service documentation.

.. index::
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_maxfeatures

**wfs_maxfeatures**
  (Optional) The maximum and default number of elements to be returned
  by the WFS server.  If the user sets the 'maxfeatures' parameter in
  a GetFeatureRequest, his value will be used, provided it does not
  exceed wfs_maxfeatures. If wfs_maxfeatures is not specified, the
  server will return all the features that match the query, without
  limit, which may make the server busy for a long time when layers
  with big number of features are served.  Sensible values are
  integers greater than 0.  If 0 is specified, no features will be
  returned. In WFS 2.0, this item is used to fill the "CountDefault"
  parameter of the response document to a GetCapabilities request, so
  that clients are aware of the server limit.
  See also the "wfs_maxfeatures_ignore_for_resulttype_hits" item.

.. index::
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_maxfeatures_ignore_for_resulttype_hits

**wfs_maxfeatures_ignore_for_resulttype_hits**
  (Optional, added in MapServer 7.2) Controls whether the limit set by
  "wfs_maxfeatures" is also taken into account in resultType=hits GetFeature requests.

  See "resultType parameter" chapter (`OGC WFS 2.0 specification`_, sect. 7.6.3.6)

  When setting this item to "false", the limit set by "wfs_maxfeatures" will also
  be taken into account when processing a resultType=hits GetFeature request, that is
  to say the number of hits returned will not be greater than wfs_maxfeatures. This is
  the behaviour in MapServer version prior to 7.2, and also the general default behaviour
  in later versions. Unless if all the layers that are queried are PostGIS layers,
  in which case wfs_maxfeatures is not taken into account when computing the number of hits.
  The item may be explicitly set to "true" so that wfs_maxfeatures is not taken
  into account when computing the number of hits (for any layer type), which may exhibit
  performance issues for large layers and/ or backends with slow access.

  This item has no effect if wfs_maxfeatures is not set.

.. index::

**wfs_return_srs_as_urn**
  (Optional) Defaults to "true" in WFS 2.0, and "false" in WFS 1.0 and 1.1.
  When set to "true", SRS in GetFeature response documents will always be
  reported with the *"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::"* syntax.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_service_onlineresource

**wfs_service_onlineresource**
  (Optional) Top-level onlineresource URL. MapServer uses the
  onlineresource metadata (if provided) in the following order:
         
  1. wfs_service_onlineresource

  2. ows_service_onlineresource

  3. wfs_onlineresource (or automatically generated URL, see the
     onlineresource section of this document)

.. index::

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; LAYER; METADATA

Layer Object
------------

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_constants

**gml_constants**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of constants.  This option allows
  you to define data that are not part of the underlying dataset and
  add them to the GML output.  Many application schemas require
  constants of one form or another.  To specify the value and type of
  the constants use gml_[item name]_value and gml_[item name]_type.

  ::
  
    "gml_constants" "const1,const2"
    "gml_const1_type" "Character"
    "gml_const1_value" "abc"
    "gml_const2_type" "Integer"
    "gml_const2_value" "999"

.. index::
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_default_items

**gml_default_items**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of items to put in a GetFeature response
  document without explicit PROPERTYNAME, or "all". 
  When a GetFeature request without explicit PROPERTYNAME is processed,
  MapServer returns all items by default. As of MapServer 7.0, this behaviour
  can be amended by specifying "gml_default_items" to specify which items (among the optional
  ones) must be returned.

.. index::
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_exclude_items

**gml_exclude_items**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of items to exclude.  As of
  MapServer 4.6, you can control how many attributes (fields) you
  expose for your data layer with metadata. The previous behaviour was
  simply to expose all attributes all of the time. The default is to
  expose no attributes at all.  An example excluding a specific field
  would be:
  
  ::
  
    "gml_include_items" "all"
    "gml_exclude_items" "Phonenum"

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_featureid

**gml_featureid**
  (Required for MapServer 4.10) Field to be used for the ID of the
  feature in the output GML.  wfs_featureid or ows_featureid can be
  specified instead.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_geometries

**gml_geometries**
  Provides a name other than the default "msGeometry" for geometry
  elements. The value is specified as a string to be used for geometry
  element names.
  "none" will exclude the geometry from MapServer integrated output
  (OGR outputformat doesn't honour this setting).

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_[geometry name]_occurances

**gml_[geometry name]_occurances**
  MapServer applies default values of 0 and 1, respectively, to the
  "minOccurs" and "maxOccurs" attributes of geometry elements, as can
  be seen in the preceding examples. To override these defaults, a
  value is assigned to a gml_[geometry name]_occurances layer metadata
  item, where again [geometry name] is the string value specified for
  gml_geometries, and the value is a comma-delimited pair containing
  the respective lower and upper bounds.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_[geometry name]_type

**gml_[geometry name]_type**
  When employing gml_geometries, it is also necessary to specify the
  geometry type of the layer. This is accomplished by providing a
  value for gml_[geometry name]_type, where [geometry name] is the
  string value specified for gml_geometries, and a value which is one
  of:

  * point
  * multipoint
  * line
  * multiline
  * polygon
  * multipolygon

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_groups

**ows/wfs_geomtype**
  (Optional, metadata shared with :ref:`OGR output <ogr_output>`). Set the geometry type of OGR layers
  created from this MapServer LAYER.  One of "Point", "LineString", "Polygon", "MultiPoint", 
  "MultiLineString", "MultiPolygon", "GeometryCollection", "Geometry", 
  or "None".  Most are fairly obvious, but "Geometry" can be used to represent
  a mix of geometry types, and "None" is sometimes suitable for layers without
  geometry.  Note that layers which are a mix of polygon and multipolygon 
  would normally have to be described as "Geometry".  To produce 2.5D output
  append "25D" to the geometry type (ie. "Polygon25D").   Note that Z values
  are only carried by MapServer if built with USE_POINT_Z_M support.

  ::

    "ows_geomtype"  "Polygon25D"

.. note:: 

    For GML output, only the "25D" suffix of the value is taken into account
    to determine whether Z coordinates should be output or not.

**gml_groups**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of group names for the layer.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_[group name]_group

**gml_[group name]_group**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of attributes in the group.  Here
  is an example:
  
  ::
  
    "gml_include_items" "all"
    "gml_groups"        "display"
    "gml_display_group" "Name_e,Name_f"

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_include_items

**gml_include_items**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of items to include, or keyword
  "all". As of MapServer 4.6, you can control how many attributes
  (fields) you expose for your data layer with this metadata. The
  previous behaviour was simply to expose all attributes all of the
  time. You can enable full exposure by using the keyword "all", such
  as:
  
  ::
  
    "gml_include_items" "all"
    
  You can specify a list of attributes (fields) for partial exposure,
  such as:
  
  ::
  
    "gml_include_items" "Name,ID"
    
  The new default behaviour is to expose no attributes at all.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_[item name]_alias

**gml_[item name]_alias**
  (Optional) An alias for an attribute's name.  The served GML will
  refer to this attribute by the alias.  Here is an example:

  ::
  
    "gml_province_alias" "prov"
    
.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_[item name]_precision

**gml_[item name]_precision**
  (Optional) Specifies the precision of the indicated field for
  formats where this is significant, such as Shapefiles.  Precision is
  the number of decimal places, and is only needed for "Real" fields.
  Currently this is only used for OGR based output formats, not the
  WFS GML2/GML3 output.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_[item name]_type

**gml_[item name]_type** (Optional)
  Specifies the type of the attribute.  Valid values are the OGR data
  types: Integer|Long|Real|Character|Date|Time|DateTime|Boolean.  MapServer translates
  these to valid GML data types.

  .. note::
    Long is to be used for 64-bit integers, starting with MapServer 7.0.1.

  .. note::
    Time and DateTime have been added in MapServer 8. And since MapServer 8,
    Date semantics is a date, without time, whereas in previous versions, it
    was used indifferently for Date, Time or DateTime.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_[item name]_value

**gml_[item name]_value**
  Used to specify values for gml_constants.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_[item name]_width

**gml_[item name]_width**
  (Optional) Specifies the width of the indicated field for formats
  where this is significant, such as Shapefiles.

.. index::
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_mandatory_items

**gml_mandatory_items**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of items to make mandatory, or keyword
  "all". 
  See gml_optional_items.

.. index::
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_optional_items

**gml_optional_items**
  (Optional) A comma delimited list of items to make optional, or
  keyword "all".
  By default, as of MapServer 7.0, all items are considered as
  optional (minOccurs="0" in the GML application schema). If
  "gml_optional_items" is specified, only the listed elements will be
  optional and other included items will be mandatory.  If there are
  more mandatory items, it might be more convenient to specify
  "gml_mandatory_items".

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; gml_types

**gml_types**
  (Optional) If this field is set to "auto" then the OGR, POSTGIS, ORACLESPATIAL,
  MSSQL, and native Shapefiles input feature drivers will
  automatically populate the type, width and precision metadata for
  the layer based on the source file. This is mainly used by
  OGR based output formats, as well as the WFS GML2/GML3 output to format
  dates. 
  
  In addition the MSSQL driver also sets nillable="true" in the output GML
  for any database fields that accept NULLs.

  This option can be overridden by setting 
  gml_[item name]_type for individual fields.

  ::

    "gml_types"   "auto"

**wfs_enable_request** (or **ows_enable_request**)
  Space separated list of requests to enable.  The default is none.
  The following requests can be enabled: `GetCapabilities`,
  `GetFeature` and `DescribeFeatureType`.  A "!" in front of a request
  will disable the request.  "*" enables all requests.

  *Examples:*

  To enable only `GetCapabilities` and `GetFeature`:

  ::

    "wfs_enable_request" "GetCapabilities GetFeature"

  To enable all requests except `GetCapabilities`

  ::

    "wfs_enable_request" "* !GetCapabilities"

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_extent

**wfs_extent**
  (Optional) Used for the layer's BoundingBox tag for cases where it
  is impossible (or very inefficient) for MapServer to probe the data
  source to figure its extents. The value for this metadata is "minx
  miny maxx maxy" separated by spaces, with the values in the layer's
  projection units. If wfs_extent is provided then it has priority and
  MapServer will NOT try to read the source file's extents.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_featureid

**wfs_featureid**
  (Required for MapServer 4.10) Field to be used for the ID of the
  feature in the output GML.  gml_featureid or ows_featureid can be
  specified instead.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_geometry_precision
   
**wfs_geometry_precision**
  (Optional, since MapServer 8.0) Specifies the precision of 
  the geometry coordinates in the generated GML, where precision 
  is the number of decimal places.  This affects WFS requests using 
  the built-in GML2/GML3 output (specifying a different OUTPUTFORMAT 
  will override this setting).
  
  .. note::
    setting *wfs_geometry_precision* here at the LAYER-level will override

- .. versionadded:: 8.0

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_metadataurl_type

**wfs_metadataurl_type**

- (Optional) The standard to which the metadata complies. Currently
  only two types are valid: "TC211" which refers to [ISO 19115], and
  "FGDC" which refers to [FGDC CSDGM]. The layer metadata
  wfs_metadataurl_format and wfs_metadataurl_href must also be
  specified.  Refer to section 12.3.5 of the `WFS 1.0.0 spec`_ (unused for WFS 2.0).
- To output several MetadataURL elements, use `wfs_metadataurl_list`

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_srs

**wfs_srs**
  If there is no SRS defined at the top-level in the mapfile then this
  SRS will be used to advertize this feature type (layer) in the
  capabilities. See the note about the SRS rules in WFS.

.. index:: 
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_title

**wfs_title**
  Same as wfs_title in the Web Object. 

.. index::
   triple: WFS; METADATA; wfs_use_default_extent_for_getfeature

**wfs_use_default_extent_for_getfeature**
  (Optional, since MapServer 7.0.4) Whether the MAP.EXTENT should be used in
  request to datasources in the absence of other spatial filter. This is the
  default behaviour, but this might affect performance in some use cases. In
  those cases, setting this item to "false" will avoid he default spatial filter to
  be appended to the request. This is only implemented for OGR datasources (since 7.0.4)
  and MSSQL2008 connections (since 7.6)

Layer Metadata API
----------------------

If `wfs_metadataurl_href` is not defined, MapServer will provide a link to
the Layer Metadata API for the given layer in the `<MetadataURL>` element.
See the :ref:`Layer Metadata API <layer_metadata>` documentation for more
information.

To-do Items and Known Limitations
==================================

- This is just a basic WFS (read-only): transaction requests are not
  supported and probably never will given the nature of MapServer.
  `GeoServer`_ or `TinyOWS`_ is recommended for those needing WFS-T
  support.

- WFS spec. seems to require that features of a given feature type
  must all be of the same geometry type (point, line, polygon). This
  works fine for shapefiles, but some data source formats supported by
  MapServer allow mixed geometry types in a single layer and this goes
  against the WFS spec. Suggestions on how to handle this are welcome
  (send suggestions to the :ref:`mapserver-dev mailing list <lists>`.
