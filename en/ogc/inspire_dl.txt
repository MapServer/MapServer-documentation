Introduction
============

INSPIRE is the name of an `European directive`_, establishing an infrastructure 
for spatial information in Europe to support Community environmental policies, 
and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment.

The INSPIRE Download Service is an implementation of the `INSPIRE Technical
Guidance Download Services v3.1`_ on top of the :ref:`WFS_server`, version 2.0
(implementation explained in the previous chapter) and an implementation of
`Technical Guidance for the implementation of INSPIRE Download Services using
Web Coverage Services`_ on top of :ref:`WCS_server`, version 2.0.
The `INSPIRE schemas`_ contain extensions to OGC WFS and WCS schemas.

In order to achieve INSPIRE Download Service compliance, the following enhancements 
have been implemented in MapServer:

- Activation of INSPIRE support (two scenarios)
- Multi-language support for certain capabilities fields
- Provision of INSPIRE specific metadata

Support for INSPIRE Download Service in MapServer uses a syntax identical to
the one used for :ref:`inspire_view_service`. Consequently, it is possible to
define shared metadata items between Download and View services by using the `ows_`
prefix instead of `wfs_` or `wcs_`. In the following examples the `ows_`
prefix is used, as the documentation is meant for both WCS and WFS.

Activation of INSPIRE support
=============================

INSPIRE specific metadata can either be referenced in an external INSPIRE 
service metadata document (scenario 1) or can be directly embedded in the 
capabilities document (scenario 2). MapServer supports both scenarios.

Activation of the corresponding scenario for INSPIRE support takes place in 
the `WEB.METADATA` section of the mapfile through 
`ows_inspire_capabilities`. If activated, the
corresponding INSPIRE  namespace as well as appropriate validation warnings are
generated in the capabilities document.

Scenario 1 - activate INSPIRE support using a reference to external service 
metadata::

  WEB
   METADATA
    "ows_inspire_capabilities" "url"
    ...
   END
  END
  
Scenario 2 - activate INSPIRE support using embedded service metadata::

  WEB
   METADATA
    "ows_inspire_capabilities" "embed"
    ...
   END
  END

.. _inspire_dl_multi-language_support:

Multi-language support for certain capabilities fields
======================================================

INSPIRE requires multi-language support and requests a list of all supported 
languages as well as the default language in the capabilities document. Based 
on the language parameter in the GetCapabilities request, certain specific 
metadata values, namely

- `ows_title`
- `ows_abstract`

need to be provided in the requested language (both at the WEB.METADATA and
LAYER.METADATA levels). If the language is not supported 
(or no language parameter is present), the default language has to be used.

For INSPIRE download service WCS, only the WEB.METADATA fields have an effect,
as the INSPIRE and language specific metadata are only relevant for the service
itself and is not required on the level of coverages.

As an extension, also not encouraged by the INSPIRE Download Services technical
guidance, MapServer supports language dependent reference data like

- `DATA "road_eng"`
- `CONNECTION "db_ger"`

All supported languages have to be specified as comma separated list (first 
language is default) through `wfs_languages` in the `WEB.METADATA` 
section of the mapfile. This language parameter is also added to the 
`OnlineResource` in the GetCapabilities output::

  WEB
   METADATA
    ...
    "ows_languages" "eng,ger"       #first default, values according ISO 639-2/B
    ...
   END
  END

For language specific metadata values, a key extension method is applied::

  WEB
   METADATA
    ...
    "ows_title.eng" "myservicetitle"
    "ows_title.ger" "myservicetitleger"
    "ows_abstract" "mylayerabstract"        #fallback
    "ows_abstract.ger" "mylayerabstractger"
    ...
   END
  END

  LAYER
    METADATA
      "wfs_title"         "title: province"
      "wfs_title.fre"     "titre: province"
      "wfs_abstract"      "abstract: province"
      "wfs_abstract.fre"  "resume: province"
      ...
     END
     ...
  END
  
For language dependent reference data, a similar approach like the 
:ref:`run-time substitution <runsub>` feature of MapServer has been followed 
(only `DATA` and `CONNECTION` values with %language% are substituted)::

  ...
    LAYER
     NAME TN.RoadTransportNetwork.RoadLink
     DATA "road_%language%"
     ...
    END
  ...

If the language is not supported (or no language parameter is present), the 
default language is substituted.

Provision of INSPIRE specific metadata
======================================

Depending on the scenario, additional metadata information is required to 
support the specification. The INSPIRE related fields are provided below.

Scenario 1 - INSPIRE related fields using referenced external service metadata::

  WEB
   METADATA
    "ows_inspire_capabilities" "url"
    "ows_languages" "eng,ger"               #first default, values according ISO 639-2/B

    "ows_inspire_metadataurl_href" "http://INSPIRE.service/metadata"
    "ows_inspire_metadataurl_format" "application/vnd.ogc.csw.capabilities.response_xml"
    "ows_inspire_dsid_code" "mycode"

    "ows_keywordlist" "ogc,wfs,gml"
    "ows_title" "myservicetitle"
    "ows_abstract" "myabstract"
    "ows_fees" "conditions unknown"         #value either "no conditions apply"|default "conditions unknown"|<specific conditions>
    "wfs_accessconstraints" "None"          #value according ISO 19115 (MD_RestrictionCode codelist) or default "None"
    "ows_contactorganization" "MapServer"   #responsible organization
    "ows_contactposition" "owner"           #responsible organization, value according "INSPIRE Metadata Regulation" (part D6)
    ...
   END
  END

Scenario 2 - INSPIRE related fields using embedded service metadata::

  WEB
   METADATA
    "ows_inspire_capabilities" "embed"
    "ows_languages" "eng,ger"               #first default, values according ISO 639-2/B

    "ows_inspire_temporal_reference" "2011-09-19"                                 #date of last revision, value according YYYY-MM-DD
    "ows_inspire_mpoc_name" "mympocname"                                          #point of contact
    "ows_inspire_mpoc_email" "mympoc@e.mail"                                      #point of contact
    "ows_inspire_metadatadate" "2011-09-19"
    "ows_inspire_resourcelocator" "http://myinspireresource"                      #URL for ResourceLocator
    "ows_inspire_keyword" "infoMapAccessService"                                  #value according "classification of spatial data services"
    "ows_inspire_dsid_code" "mycode"
    "ows_inspire_dsid_ns" "http://mycode"

    "ows_keywordlist" "ogc,wfs,gml"
    "ows_title" "myservicetitle"
    "ows_abstract" "myabstract"
    "ows_fees" "conditions unknown"         #value either "no conditions apply"|default "conditions unknown"|<specific conditions>
    "ows_accessconstraints" "None"          #value according ISO 19115 (MD_RestrictionCode codelist) or default "None"
    "ows_contactorganization" "MapServer"   #responsible organization
    "ows_contactposition" "owner"           #responsible organization, value according "INSPIRE Metadata Regulation" (part D6)
    ...
   END
  END

Notes:

- this `mailing list exchange`_ gives a few hints how to fill the wfs_inspire_dsid_code
  metadata item.
- regarding scenario 2, 
  `<inspire_common:ResourceType>` is always set to service and 
  `<inspire_common:SpatialDataServiceType>` is always set to download, both 
  values can't be altered through the mapfile
- conformity is always set to not evaluated, based on the latest 
  `INSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules`_ (page 7), a specification document, 
  the specification date and a specification URI or URL need to be provided for 
  degree conformant/not conformant, which is currently not implemented
