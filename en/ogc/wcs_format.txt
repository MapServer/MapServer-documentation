This document explains how to use MapServer to deliver Landsat, SPOT, DEM, and
NetCDF temporal/banded data through the MapServer WCS interface. Thanks go to
Steve Lime and Frank Warmerdam for their assistance with these projects

It also shows how to configure MapServer for GRIB2 output format.

Landsat
=======

To serve Landsat imagery through the MapServer Web Coverage Service specify
the :ref:`OUTPUTFORMAT` object. For format support install the GDAL library
and from the command prompt and cd to where GDAL is installed and use the
command, gdalinfo --formats. A list of all supported formats will appear and
will specify if the format is read only **<ro>** or read and write **<rw>**
for WCS the format needs to be supported for read and write (except for
*GDAL's* own WCS format, however).

For the example below the Landsat 7 15m resolution mosaic is in a Enhanced
Compressed Wavelets format (ECW). By running the gdalinfo.exe program I could
verify that the ECW format has write permissions, therefore the format can be
specified in the MapFile and requested using the GetCoverage request. 

.. code-block:: mapfile

    OUTPUTFORMAT
        NAME "ECW"
        DRIVER "GDAL/ECW"
        MIMETYPE "image/ecw"
        IMAGEMODE "BYTE"
        EXTENSION "ecw"
    END

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME "Landsat7"
        STATUS OFF
        TYPE RASTER
        PROCESSING "SCALE=AUTO"
        UNITS Meters
        TILEINDEX "MapServer/wcs/landsat7/l7mosaic15m.shp"
        TILEITEM "Location"
        METADATA
          "wcs_description" "Landsat 7 15m resolution mosaic"
          "wcs_name" "Landsat7"
          "wcs_label" "Landsat 7 15m resolution mosaic"
          "ows_srs" "EPSG:27700"
          "ows_extent" "0 0 700005 1050000"
          "wcs_resolution" "75 75"
          "wcs_bandcount" "3"
          "wcs_formats" "ECW"
          "wcs_enable_request" "*"
        END
     END

A GetCoverage request can then be requested (using the parameters set in the
MapFile) by creating a URL with the elements: - Your Server, MapServer
Program, Location of MapFile, Type of Service (WCS), Request (GetCoverage),
Coverage (Landsat7), BBOX (0,0,700005,1050000), CRS (EPSG:27700), ResX (75)
ResY (75), Format (ECW).

SPOT
====

SPOT imagery can be delivered through MapServer Web Coverage Service similarly
to the Landsat example above. The main difference is that as SPOT is a
greyscale image the wcs_bandcount = 1 rather than a Landsat image which
consists of 3 bands. For this example the well known GeoTiff format will be
used to demonstrate what to specify in a MapFile for SPOT data. 

.. code-block:: mapfile

    OUTPUTFORMAT
        NAME "GEOTIFF"
        DRIVER "GDAL/GTiff"
        MIMETYPE "image/tiff"
        IMAGEMODE "BYTE"
        EXTENSION "tif"
    END
    LAYER
        NAME "SPOT"
        STATUS OFF
        TYPE RASTER
        PROCESSING "SCALE=AUTO"
        UNITS Meters
        TILEINDEX "MapServer/wcs/orthospot/spot.shp"
        TILEITEM "Location"
        METADATA
          "wcs_description" "Orthospot mosaic"
          "wcs_name" "SPOT"
          "wcs_label" "Orthospot mosaic"
          "ows_srs" "EPSG:27700"
          "ows_extent" "375960 64480 497410 200590"
          "wcs_resolution" "100 100"
          "wcs_bandcount" "1"
          "wcs_formats" "GEOTIFF"
          "wcs_nativeformat" "8-bit GeoTIF"
          "wcs_enable_request" "*"
        END
    END

The key parameters to specify in the WCS MapFile for any data layer and format
are::

    - Layer Name = Create a short name for the data
    - Layer Type = Raster

The following examples further demonstrate how WCS can be implemented and also
how to create WCS containing layers with a temporal dimension (see NetCDF
example).

DEM
===

It is possible to deliver 16 bit DEM data through the MapServer Web Coverage
Service.

Firstly it is necessary to specify the output format in the map file

.. code-block:: mapfile

    OUTPUTFORMAT
      NAME "GEOTIFFINT16"
      DRIVER "GDAL/GTiff"
      MIMETYPE "image/tiff"
      IMAGEMODE "INT16"
      EXTENSION "tif"
    END

and the corresponding layer

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME "srtm"
      STATUS OFF
      TYPE RASTER
      DATA "srtm.tif"
      PROJECTION
        "init=epsg:4326"
      END
      METADATA
        "wcs_label" "SRTM WCS TIF Server"
        "ows_extent" "-180 -90 180 90"
        "wcs_resolution" "0.00083 -0.00083"
        "ows_srs" "EPSG:4326"
        "wcs_formats" "GEOTIFFINT16"
        "wcs_nativeformat" "geotiff"
        "wcs_enable_request" "*"
      END
    END

Performance gains can be made by using the gdaladdo utility described at
https://gdal.org/programs/gdaladdo.html

NetCDF
======

Firstly GDAL doesn't support all versions of netCDF (there are a lot, it is a
generic format), so for stability it may be necessary to convert the files
into GeoTiff format first. This can be achieved using the netCDF libraries
here https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/. Denis
Nadeau and Frank Warmerdam have added netCDF CF as a read only format within
GDAL, so it now possible to read the CF convention netCDF files directly from
disk.

We placed the Z-levels in the bands of the GDAL data file (either GeoTiff or
netCDF), and created a shape index for the time levels. GDAL data is a 2-D
format (x,y) and bands. netCDF is an N-D file format, supporting time, x,y,z,
and experiment parameters. By using a set of GDAL netCDF / geoTiff files it is
possible to represent this, and to store the z-level (height) as bands within
the data file. Although a hack, it is possible for a custom client to receive
important metadata from the describeCoverage operation of a WCS about the
which z-level a band of a geotiff represents by encoding this in the returned
axes description tag.

To create the shape file for the temporal dimension we had to do some hacking
with Java code, but we also got it to work with Steve Lime' s perl script in
the MODIS MapServer demo download (which doesn't seem to be available now).

The perl script used in Modis demo by Steve Lime is as follows, and I have
placed inline comments below. The script assumes that gdaltindex has already
been run in this directory to create a tile index shape and dbf file. It
assumes that the filenames of your data files have the date in the filename,
for example myfileYYYYMMDDHH.tif 

.. code-block:: perl
    :linenos:

      #!/usr/bin/perl
      use XBase;
      opendir(DIR, '.'); # open the current directory
      foreach $file (readdir(DIR)) {
        next if !($file =~ /\.dbf$/); # read the dbf file in this directory created by gdaltindex
        print "Working on $file...\n";
        $tfile = 'temporary.dbf';
        system("mv $file $tfile");
        $oldtable = new XBase $tfile or die XBase->errstr;
        print join("\t", $oldtable->field_names) ."\n";
        print join("\t", $oldtable->field_types) ."\n";
        print join("\t", $oldtable->field_lengths) ."\n";
        print join("\t", $oldtable->field_decimals) ."\n";
        $newtable = XBase->create("name" => $file,
                      "field_names" => [$oldtable->field_names, "IMGDATE"],  # this is the FILTERITEM in the corresponding tile index layer within your mapfile
                      "field_types" => [$oldtable->field_types, "C"],  # character column type
                      "field_lengths" => [$oldtable->field_lengths, 13], # length of the date string
                      "field_decimals" => [$oldtable->field_decimals, undef]) or die "Error creating new table.";
        foreach (0 .. $oldtable->last_record) {
        ($deleted, @data) = $oldtable->get_record($_);
        print "  ...record $data[0]\n";
            # extract the date
            $year = substr $data[0], 8, 4;  # year  is at position 8 in the filename string
            $month = substr $data[0], 12, 2;  # month is at position 12 in the filename string
            $day = substr $data[0], 14, 2; # day is at position 14 in the filename string
            $hour = substr $data[0], 16, 2;  # hour is at position 16 in the filename string
            $date =  "$year-$month-$day" . "T" . "$hour\n"; # format is YYYY-MM-DDTHH, or any ISO format
         print "$date";
            push @data, "$date";
        $newtable->set_record($_, @data);
        }
        $newtable->close();
        $oldtable->close();
        unlink($tfile);
      }

If have used the perl script then skip to the layer definitions below, if you
wish to code your own the description is here.

The DBF file has to have the column 'location' that indicates the location of
the data file (either absolute path or relative to the map file location, and
the second column that can be called whatever you want but indexes time. In
our case we called it 'time' :-)

The corresponding shapefile then has to contain Polygons with the bounding
boxes of the tif file for each time. So OGRInfo timeIndex.shp looks something
like::

  OGRFeature(timeIndex):116
    location(String) = mytime.tif
    time(String) = 2001-01-31T18:00:00
    POLYGON ((xxx,xxxx,.......))


Define your output format as

.. code-block:: mapfile

    OUTPUTFORMAT
      NAME "GEOTIFF_FLOAT"
      DRIVER 'GDAL/GTiff'
      MIMETYPE 'image/tiff'
      IMAGEMODE FLOAT32
      EXTENSION 'tif'
    END

Then you need to define your tile index within the map file

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME 'time_idx'
      TYPE TILEINDEX
      DATA 'timeIndex'
      FILTERITEM 'time'
      FILTER '%time%'
    END

and the actual layer

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME 'TempData'
      STATUS OFF
      TYPE RASTER
      TILEINDEX 'time_idx'
      PROJECTION
        "init=epsg:4326"
      END
      METADATA
        "wcs_label" 'Temperature data'
        "ows_extent" '-180 -90 180 90'
        "wcs_resolution" '1.125 -1.125'
        "ows_srs" 'EPSG:4326'
        "wcs_formats" 'GEOTIFF_FLOAT'
        "wcs_nativeformat" 'netCDF'
        "wcs_bandcount" '27'
        "wcs_rangeset_axes" 'bands'
        "wcs_rangeset_label" 'Pressure (hPa units) Levels'
        "wcs_rangeset_name" 'bands'
        "wcs_rangeset_description" 'Z levels '  
        "wcs_timeposition" '2001-01-01T06:00:00,2001-01-01T12:00:00,2001-01-01T18:00:00,2001-01-02T00:00:00'
        "wcs_timeitem" 'time'
        "wcs_enable_request" "*"
      END
    END

The TempData coverage layer will now let you subset with the &bands=...
&time=... subset parameters!

To do a coordinate reprojection specify in the request &Response_CRS=ESPG:xxxx

When you start doing temporal subsetting with WCS and MapServer you can see
the need for an automatic way of generating map files such as using an XSL
stylesheet!

For a tile-index layer you need to provide the following extra metadata in
order to use it for WCS:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    "OWS_EXTENT" "10050 299950 280050 619650" 
    "WCS_RESOLUTION" "100 100" 
    "WCS_SIZE" "2700 3197"
    "WCS_BANDCOUNT" "3"

If your image has a colortable and only one band, it will come out greyscale
unless you set the IMAGEMODE to PC256 instead of BYTE.

GRIB2 output format
===================

This requires MapServer 7.2.0 for format-specific and layer-specific
creation options mechanism, as well as GDAL 2.3.0 for GRIB2 output support.


Define your output format as

.. code-block:: mapfile

    OUTPUTFORMAT
        NAME GRIB
        DRIVER "GDAL/GRIB"
        MIMETYPE "application/x-grib2"
        IMAGEMODE Float32
        EXTENSION "grib2"
        FORMATOPTION "DATA_ENCODING=SIMPLE_PACKING"
    END

(consult `GDAL GRIB driver documentation`_ for more options that can be 
provided in FORMATOPTION)

and the actual layer

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME temperatures
        TYPE raster
        STATUS ON
        DUMP TRUE
