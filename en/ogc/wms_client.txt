Introduction
============

A WMS (or Web Map Server) allows for use of data from several different servers, 
and enables for the creation of a network of Map Servers from which clients can 
build customized maps.  The following document contains information about using 
MapServer's WMS connection type to include layers from remote WMS servers in 
MapServer applications.

MapServer  supports the following WMS versions when acting as client:
1.0.0, 1.0.7, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.3.0 (see :ref:`ogc_support` for an updated
list).

This document assumes that you are already familiar with certain aspects of 
MapServer:

- MapServer application development and setting up .map files.
- Familiarity with the WMS spec would be an asset. A link to the WMS specification 
  document is included below. 

WMS-Related Information
-----------------------

- :ref:`MapServer WMS Server HowTo <wms_server>`
- `WMS 1.3.0 specification`_
- `WMS 1.1.1 specification`_
- OGC's `WMS homepage <https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms>`__
- `MapServer OGC Web Services Workshop package`_ 

Compilation / Installation
==========================

The WMS connection type is enabled by the *--with-wmsclient* configure switch. 
It requires PROJ, GDAL and libcurl version 7.10.1 or more recent.   Windows 
users who do not want to compile MapServer should use 
`MS4W`_ (which comes ready for WMS/WFS client and server use), or check for the
availability of other :ref:`Windows binaries <windows>` with WMS support.

- For PROJ and GDAL installation, see the MapServer Compilation HowTo (:ref:`unix` / :ref:`win32`)
- For `libcurl`_, make sure you have version 7.10.1 or more recent installed on your 
  system. You can find out your libcurl version using *curl-config --version*. 
  (if your system came with an older version of libcurl preinstalled then you MUST 
  uninstall it prior to installing the new version) 

Once the required libraries are installed, then configure MapServer using the 
*--with-wmsclient* switch (plus all the other switches you used to use) and recompile.
This will give you a new set of executables (and possibly php_mapscript.so if you 
requested it). See the MapServer Compilation HowTo (links above) for installation details. 

Check your MapServer executable
-------------------------------

To check that your mapserv executable includes WMS support, use the "-v" command-line 
switch and look for "SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT".

Example 1. Mapserv Version Info on Unix:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./mapserv -v
   MapServer version 7.7-dev OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=KML 
   SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=AGG SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=CAIRO 
   SUPPORTS=SVG_SYMBOLS SUPPORTS=RSVG SUPPORTS=ICONV SUPPORTS=FRIBIDI 
   SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WFS_SERVER 
   SUPPORTS=WFS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WCS_SERVER SUPPORTS=SOS_SERVER 
   SUPPORTS=GEOS SUPPORTS=POINT_Z_M SUPPORTS=PBF INPUT=JPEG 
   INPUT=POSTGIS INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE 

Example 2. Mapserv Version Info on Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

   C:\ms4w> mapserv -v
   MapServer version 7.6.0-dev (MS4W 4.0.3) OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG 
   OUTPUT=KML SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=AGG SUPPORTS=FREETYPE 
   SUPPORTS=CAIRO SUPPORTS=SVG_SYMBOLS SUPPORTS=SVGCAIRO 
   SUPPORTS=ICONV SUPPORTS=FRIBIDI SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER 
   SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WFS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WFS_CLIENT 
   SUPPORTS=WCS_SERVER SUPPORTS=SOS_SERVER SUPPORTS=FASTCGI 
   SUPPORTS=THREADS SUPPORTS=GEOS SUPPORTS=POINT_Z_M SUPPORTS=PBF 
   INPUT=JPEG INPUT=POSTGIS INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE 
 
.. index:: 
   pair: WMS Client; Mapfile

MapFile Configuration
=====================


.. note::

    A :ref:`projection` must be set in the mapfile for the MAP unless you are sure that all your 
    WMS layers support only a single projection which is the same as the PROJECTION of the map. 
    The MAP PROJECTION can be set using "init=epsg:xxxx" codes or using regular PROJ parameters. 
    Failure to set a MAP PROJECTION may result in blank maps coming from remote WMS servers 
    (because of inconsistent BBOX+SRS combination being used in the WMS connection URL).

Storing Temporary Files
-----------------------

Since MapServer version 6.0 when `wms_cache_to_disk` metadata is turned on (and for MapServer 
< 6.0), you have to set the `IMAGEPATH` value in the `WEB` object of your mapfile to point to a valid and 
writable directory. MapServer will use this directory to store temporary files downloaded from 
the remote servers. The temporary files are automatically deleted by MapServer so you won't 
notice them.

Example 3. Setting IMAGEPATH Parameter in Mapfile

.. code-block:: mapfile

      MAP
        ...
        WEB
          IMAGEPATH "/tmp/ms_tmp/"
          IMAGEURL ...
        END
        ...
      END                        
            
MS4W Users Should Specify the Following for IMAGEPATH and IMAGEURL:

.. code-block:: mapfile

      MAP
        ...
        WEB
          IMAGEPATH "/ms4w/tmp/ms_tmp/" 
          IMAGEURL "/ms_tmp/"
        END
        ...
      END   



If you want to keep this temporary file for debugging purposes, you should add the following 
statement to the LAYER object of your mapfile:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      ....
      DEBUG ON
      ... 
    END
    
.. seealso::
    
    :ref:`debugging` 

Configuring for HTTPS Connections
---------------------------------

Follow the :ref:`wxs_secure` document to make sure that your local server can connect through 
HTTPS secured connections.        
      
Adding a WMS Layer
------------------

WMS layers are accessed via the WMS connection type in the :ref:`mapfile`. Here is an 
example of a layer using this connection type:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME "country_bounds"
      TYPE RASTER
      STATUS ON
      CONNECTION "https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wms?"
      CONNECTIONTYPE WMS
      METADATA
        "wms_srs"             "EPSG:4326"
        "wms_name"            "country_bounds"
        "wms_server_version"  "1.1.1"
        "wms_format"          "image/png"
      END
    END
    
You can also combine remote WMS layers from a server into one layer, separated 
by a comma (,) such as:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      NAME "census_tracts"
      TYPE RASTER
      STATUS ON
      CONNECTION "http://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/services/TIGERweb/tigerWMS_ACS2015/MapServer/WMSServer?"
      CONNECTIONTYPE WMS
      METADATA
          "wms_srs" 		"EPSG:4326"
          "wms_name" 		"Census Tracts,Census Tracts Labels"
          "wms_server_version" 	"1.1.1"
          "wms_format" 	  	"image/png24"
      END
    END   
   
.. NOTE::
   Layer names must be separated by a comma, without any spaces around the comma

   triple: WMS Client; LAYER; METADATA

Required Layer Parameters and Metadata
**************************************


**CONNECTIONTYPE WMS**

**CONNECTION**

- *Description:* This is the remote server's online resource URL, just the base URL 
  without any of the WMS parameters. The server version, image format, 
  layer name, etc. will be provided via metadata, see below.

  .. note::

      Note that if the CONNECTION parameter value is not set the the value of 
      the "wms_onlineresource" metadata will be used. If both CONNECTION and 
      "wms_onlineresource" are set then the "wms_onlineresource" metadata takes precedence.

**"wms_format" metadata** 

- *Description:* The image format to use in GetMap requests.

  .. note:: 

      If wms_formatlist is provided then wms_format is optional and MapServer will 
      pick the first supported format in wms_formatlist for use in GetMap requests. 
      If both wms_format and wms_formatlist are provided then wms_format takes precedence.
      Also note that WMS Servers only advertize supported formats that are part of the GD/GDAL 
      libraries. 

**"wms_name" metadata**
 
- *Description:* Comma-separated list of layers to be fetched from the remote WMS server. This 
  value is used to set the LAYERS and QUERY_LAYERS WMS URL parameters.  Note that when 
  specifying multiple layers there must not be any spaces between the comma and the layer name.
  
**"wms_server_version" metadata**

- *Description:* The version of the WMS protocol supported by the remote WMS server and that will be 
  used for issuing GetMap requests.

**"wms_srs" metadata**

- *Description:* Space-delimited list of EPSG projection codes supported by the remote server. 
  You normally get this from the server's capabilities output. This value should 
  be upper case (EPSG:4236.....not epsg:4236) to avoid problems with case sensitive 
  platforms. The value is used to set the SRS WMS URL parameter.

Optional Layer Parameters and Metadata
**************************************

**MINSCALE, MAXSCALE** 

- *Description:* If the remote server's capabilities contains a ScaleHint value for this layer 
  then you might want to set the MINSCALE and MAXSCALE in the LAYER object in the mapfile. 
  This will allow MapServer to request the layer only at scales where it makes sense

**PROJECTION object** 

- *Description:* It is optional at this point. MapServer will create one internally if needed.  Including one may 
  allow MapServer to avoid looking up a definition in the PROJ init files.

**"wms_auth_username" metadata**

- *Description:* msEncrypt-style authorization string.  Empty strings are also accepted.

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_auth_username" "foo"
      "wms_auth_password" "{FF88CFDAAE1A5E33}"
    END

**"wms_auth_type" metadata**

- *Description:* Authorization type.  Supported types include:
    - basic
    - digest
    - ntlm
    - any (the underlying http library picks the best among the opotions supported by the remote server)
    - anysafe (the underlying http library picks only safe methods among the options supported by the remote server)

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_auth_type" "ntlm"
    END

**"wms_connectiontimeout" metadata** 

- *Description:* The maximum time to wait for a remote WMS layer to load, set in seconds (default is 30 
  seconds). This metadata can be added at the layer level so that it affects only that layer, 
  or it can be added at the map level (in the web object) so that it affects all of the layers. 
  Note that wms_connectiontimeout at the layer level has priority over the map level.

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      ...
      "wms_connectiontimeout" "60"
      ...
    END  

**"wms_essential" metadata**

  .. versionadded:: 7.6.0

- *Description:* Set this to "1" to mark this WMS layer as essential. Normally, when a request to a WMS layer fails, this layer
  will be skipped and the map is rendered without the layer. If the layer is essential and fails, the map will not
  be rendered and an exception is thrown.
    
  .. note::
      enabling `wms_essential` means that if there is a problem with the connection,
      (such as the `CONNECTION` url cannot be reached, or an incorrect `wms_name` 
      or `wms_format`) an XML error will be returned in the browser.  If you are calling 
      MapServer through commandline, your :ref:`map` setting for `CONFIG "ON_MISSING_DATA"` 
      will still be leveraged for how that error is handled locally. 

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      ...
      "wms_essential" "1"
      ...
    END       

**"wms_exceptions_format" metadata**

- *Description:* Set the format for exceptions (as of MapServer 4.6). MapServer defaults to 
  *application/vnd.ogc.se_inimage* (the exception will be in a picture format).  You can 
  check the GetCapabilities of the server to see what formats are available for exceptions.  
  The *application/vnd.ogc.se_inimage* exception format is actually a non-required exception 
  format in the WMS 1.1.1 spec, so there are servers out there which don't support this format. In that case you would use:

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
      ...
      METADATA
        "wms_exceptions_format" "application/vnd.ogc.se_xml"
      END
      ...
    END

  Which would return this xml exception in the MS_ERRORFILE:

  ::

    Tue Jan 17 18:05:13 2006 - msDrawWMSLayerLow(): WMS server error.
    WMS GetMap request got XML exception for layer 'prov_bound':
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding="ISO-8859-1" standalone="no" ?>
    <!DOCTYPE ServiceExceptionReport SYSTEM
    "http://schemas.opengis.net/wms/1.1.1/exception_1_1_1.dtd">
    <ServiceExceptionReport version="1.1.1"><ServiceException
    code="LayerNotDefined">
    msWMSLoadGetMapParams(): WMS server error. Invalid layer(s)
    given in the LAYERS parameter.
    </ServiceException>
    </ServiceExceptionReport>

**"wms_force_separate_request" metadata** 

- *Description:* Set this to "1" to force this WMS layer to be requested using its own separate GetMap 
  request. By default MapServer will try to merge multiple adjacent WMS layers from the 
  same server into a single multi-layer GetMap request to reduce the load on remote servers 
  and improve response time. This metadata is used to bypass that behavior. 

**"wms_formatlist" metadata** 

- *Description:* Comma-separated list of image formats supported by the remote WMS server.
  Note that wms_formatlist is used only if wms_format is not set. If both wms_format and 
  wms_formatlist are provided then wms_format takes precedence.

**"wms_latlonboundingbox" metadata**

- *Description:* The bounding box of this layer in geographic coordinates in the format "lon_min lat_min 
  lon_max lat_max". If it is set then MapServer will request the layer only when the map 
  view overlaps that bounding box. You normally get this from the server's capabilities 
  output.
 
  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_latlonboundingbox" "-124 48 -123 49"
    END

**"wms_proxy_auth_type" metadata**

- *Description:* The authorization type to use for a proxy connection.  Supported types include:

    - basic
    - digest
    - ntlm
    - any (the underlying http library picks the best among the opotions supported by the remote server)
    - anysafe (the underlying http library picks only safe methods among the options supported by the remote server)

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_proxy_auth_type" "ntlm"
    END 

**"wms_proxy_host" metadata**

- *Description:* The hostname of the proxy to use, in "dot-quad" format, with an optional port component (e.g. '192.168.2.10:8080').

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_proxy_host" "192.168.2.10"
    END 

**"wms_proxy_port" metadata**

- *Description:* The port to use for a proxy connection.

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_proxy_port" "8080"
    END   

**"wms_proxy_type" metadata**

- *Description:* The type of the proxy connection.  Valid values are 'http' and 'socks5', which are case sensitive.

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_proxy_type" "http"
    END 

**"wms_proxy_username" metadata**

- *Description:* msEncrypt-style string for a proxy connection.  Empty strings are also accepted.

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      "wms_proxy_username" "foo"
      "wms_proxy_password" "{FF88CFDAAE1A5E33}"
    END 

**"wms_sld_body" metadata**

- *Description:* Can be used to specify an inline SLD document.

**"wms_sld_url" metadata**

- *Description:* Can be used to specify a link to an SLD document.
          
**"wms_style" metadata** 

- *Description:* Name of style to use for the STYLES parameter in GetMap requests for this layer.

**"wms_style_<stylename>_sld" metadata**
 
- *Description:* URL of a SLD to use in GetMap requests. Replace 
  <stylename> in the metadta name with the name of the style to which the SLD applies.

  .. code-block:: mapfile

    METADATA
      ...
      "wms_style"              "mystyle"
      "wms_style_mystyle_sld"  "http://my.host.com/mysld.xml"
      ...
    END
          
  For more information on SLDs in MapServer see the :ref:`SLD HowTo document <sld>`.

**"wms_time" metadata** 

- *Description:* Value to use for the TIME parameter in GetMap requests for this layer. Please see the 
  :ref:`WMS Time HowTo <wms_time>` for more information.

**"wms_bgcolor" metadata**

- *Description:* Specifies the color to be used as the background of the map. The 
  general format of BGCOLOR is a hexadecimal encoding of an RGB value where two hexadecimal
  characters are used for each of Red, Green, and Blue color values. The values can range 
  between 00 and FF for each (0 and 255, base 10). The format is 0xRRGGBB; either upper or 
  lower case characters are allowed for RR, GG, and BB values. The "0x" prefix shall have 
  a lower case "x".

**"wms_transparent" metadata**

- *Description:* Specifies whether the map background is to be made transparent or not. 
  TRANSPARENT can take on two values, "TRUE" or "FALSE".  If not specified, MapServer sets 
  default to "TRUE".

**"wms_cache_to_disk" metadata**

- *Description:* Set this to "1" to force MapServer to write fetched images to disk.  Writing to disk 
  is necessary to take advantage of MapServer's caching logic to avoid refetching WMS
  requests made previously.  This feature is new to MapServer 6.0 - previously results were always written
  to disk.

**"wms_nonsquare_ok" metadata**

- *Description:* Set this to "0" to indicate that the remote WMS only supports requests for square pixels.  In this
  case MapServer will be careful to only make square pixel requests even if it means oversampling in one
  dimension compared to the resolution of image data required.  This feature is new to MapServer 6.0.

**"wms_extent" metadata**

- *Description:* If there is exactly one SRS supported by this layer (as listed in the wms_srs metadata), and if 
  the wms_extent metadata item (or an extent specified via the EXTENT keyword) is set then MapServer will
  take care to only making requests within this area.  This can short circuit requests completely outside
  the layer, reduce processing for layers that only partially overlap the target map area and avoid poor
  behaviors with reprojection in some areas.  The contents of this metadata item should be of the form
  "minx miny maxx maxy".  This feature is new to MapServer 6.0.

**"wms_strict_axis_order metadata**

- *Description:* Set this to "1" or "true" to force WMS requests to use strict axis order according to the EPSG code,
  or "0" or "false" to force WMS requests to always use xy (or lonlat) axis order. This should only be
  necessary if the axis order interpretation of the server for the chosen EPSG code does not conform to
  the standard: In the case of WMS 1.0 and 1.1 the assumption is to always use xy (default 0/false),
  for WMS 1.3.0 the assumption is strict axis order according to the EPSG database (default 1/true).

.. note::

    Note that each of the above metadata can also be referred to as 'ows_*' instead of 'wms_*'. 
    MapServer tries the 'wms_*' metadata first, and if not found it tries the corresponding 
    'ows_*' name. Using this reduces the amount of duplication in mapfiles that support multiple 
    OGC interfaces since "ows_*" metadata can be used almost everywhere for common metadata items 
    shared by multiple OGC interfaces.

Old CONNECTION parameter format from version 3.5 and 3.6 (deprecated)
*********************************************************************

In MapServer version 3.5 and 3.6, the CONNECTION parameter had to include at a 
minimum the VERSION, LAYERS, FORMAT and TRANSPARENT WMS parameters. This mode of 
operation is still supported but is deprecated and you are encouraged to use metadata 
items for those parameters as documented in the previous section above.

Here is an example of a layer definition using this deprecated CONNECTION parameter format:

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
     NAME "bathymetry_elevation"
     TYPE RASTER
     STATUS ON
     CONNECTIONTYPE WMS
     CONNECTION "http://demo.org/cgi-bin/wms?VERSION=1.1.0&LAYERS=bm&FORMAT=image/png"
     PROJECTION
       "init=epsg:4326"
     END
    END
    
Limitations/TODO
================

1. GetFeatureInfo is not fully supported since the output of getFeatureInfo is 
   left to the discretion of the remote server. A method layer.getWMSFeatureInfoURL() 
   has been added to MapScript for applications that want to access featureInfo results 
   and handle them directly.
   
2. MapServer does not attempt to fetch the layer's capabilities. Doing so at every 
   map draw would be extremely inefficient. And caching that information does not belong 
   in the core of MapServer. This is better done at the application level, in a script, 
   and only the necessary information is passed to the MapServer core via the CONNECTION 
   string and metadata.
