Introduction
============

A WCS (or Web Coverage Service) allows for the publication of
"coverages"- digital geospatial information representing space-varying
phenomena. In the MapServer world it allows for unfiltered access to
raster data. Conceptually it is easy think of WCS as a raster
equivalent of WFS. The following documentation is based on the `Open
Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) Web Coverage Service Interfaces
Implementation Specification version 1.0.0`_.

Software Requirements
---------------------

In order to enable MapServer to serve WCS data, it MUST be compiled
against certain libraries:

- PROJ: The reprojection library. Version 4.4.3 or greater is required.
- GDAL: raster support library.
- MapServer: version >= 4.4 (tested with 5.0.2 while updating this document)

For WCS 1.1.x (MapServer 5.2) and WCS 2.0 (MapServer 6.0) support
there is an additional requirement:

- libxml2: An xml parser and generation library. 

Please see the :ref:`MapServer UNIX Compilation and Installation HowTo
<unix>` for detailed instructions on compiling MapServer with support
for these libraries and features.  For Windows users, `MapServer for
Windows (MS4W)`_ comes with WCS Server support.

Configuring Your Mapfile to Serve WCS Layers
============================================

Much as in the WMS and WFS support, WCS publishing is enabled by
adding certain magic METADATA keyword/value pairs to a .map file.

MapServer will serve and include in its WCS capabilities only the
layers that meet the following conditions:

- Data source is a raster, which is processed using GDAL 
  (e.g GeoTIFF, Erdas Imagine, ...)
- LAYER NAME must be set
- LAYER TYPE is set to RASTER
- WEB metadata or LAYER metadata "wcs_enable_request" must be set
- WEB metadata "wcs_label" must be set
- LAYER metadata "wcs_label" must be set
- LAYER metadata "wcs_rangeset_name" must be set
- LAYER metadata "wcs_rangeset_label" must be set
- LAYER is enabled to be served via WCS (see `MS RFC 67`_)

- LAYER PROJECTION must be set, even if PROJECTION is set at the MAP
  level (a bug?)

Example WCS Server Mapfile

The following is an example of a simple WCS Server mapfile. Note the
comments for the required parameters.

.. index:: 
   pair: WCS Server; Output formats

Output Formats
--------------

The raster formats supported by MapServer WCS are determined by the
wcs_formats metadata item on the LAYER.  This should contain a space
separated list of OUTPUTFORMAT driver names separated by spaces.  If
absent, all raster OUTPUTFORMATs are allowed.

WCS is a "raw data" oriented format.  So it often most suitable to use
it with format using the BYTE, INT16 and FLOAT32 IMAGEMODEs with GDAL
related output formats rather than the built in "rendering oriented"
output formats.  By default the only GDAL format driver defined is the
GTiff driver.  The following are example output format declarations
utilizing the raw image modes::

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME GEOTIFF_16
    DRIVER "GDAL/GTiff"
    MIMETYPE "image/tiff"
    IMAGEMODE FLOAT32
    EXTENSION "tif"
  END

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME AAIGRID
    DRIVER "GDAL/AAIGRID"
    MIMETYPE "image/x-aaigrid"
    IMAGEMODE INT16
    EXTENSION "grd"
    FORMATOPTION "FILENAME=result.grd"
  END

The FORMATOPTION FILENAME defines the preferred name of the result
file when returned WCS GetCoverage results.
  
	
Test Your WCS 1.0 Server
========================

Validate the Capabilities Metadata
----------------------------------

OK, now that we've got a mapfile, we have to check the XML
capabilities returned by our server to make sure nothing is missing.

Using a web browser, access your server's online resource URL to which
you add the parameters
"SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities" to the end, e.g.

::

  http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=mywcs.map&SERVICE=WCS
    &VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities
    
.. NOTE::
   It is strongly recommended to review the security steps for the *MAP=*
   call to the MapServer executable, by setting *MS_MAP_PATTERN* or 
   *MS_MAP_NO_PATH* or hiding the *MAP=* parameter on public servers, 
   as recommended in the document :ref:`limit_mapfile_access`.  All possible
   environment variables to secure your server are listed in :ref:`environment_variables`.   
        

If you get an error message in the XML output then take necessary
actions. Common problems and solutions are listed in the FAQ at the
end of this document.

If everything went well, you should have a complete XML capabilities
document.  Search it for the word "WARNING"... MapServer inserts XML
comments starting with "<!--WARNING: " in the XML output if it detects
missing mapfile parameters or metadata items.

Note that when a request happens, it is passed through WMS, WFS, and
WCS in MapServer (in that order) until one of the services respond to
it.

Here is a working example of a GetCapabilities request:

`WCS GetCapabilities live example`_

Test With a DescribeCoverage Request
------------------------------------

OK, now that we know that our server can produce a valid XML
GetCapabilities response we should test the DescribeCoverage request.
The DescribeCoverage request lists more information about specific
coverage offerings.

Using a web browser, access your server's online resource URL to which
you add the parameters
"SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=DescribeCoverage&COVERAGE=layername"
to the end, e.g.

::

  http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=mywcs.map&SERVICE=WCS
    &VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=DescribeCoverage&COVERAGE=bathymetry
  
Here is a working example of a DescribeCoverage request:

`WCS DescribeCoverage live example`_


Test With a GetCoverage Request
-------------------------------

The GetCoverage request allows for the retrieval of coverages in a
specified output format to the client.


The following is a list of the required GetCoverage parameters
according to the WCS spec:

   **VERSION=version:** Request version

   **REQUEST=GetCoverage:** Request name

   **COVERAGE=coverage_name:** Name of an available coverage, as
   stated in the GetCapabilities

   **CRS=epsg_code:** Coordinate Reference System in which the request
   is expressed.

   **BBOX=minx,miny,maxx,maxy:** Bounding box corners (lower left,
   upper right) in CRS units.  One of BBOX or TIME is required.
   
   **TIME=time1,time2:** Request a subset corresponding to a time. One
   of BBOX or TIME is required..

   **WIDTH=output_width:** Width in pixels of map picture.  One of
   WIDTH/HEIGHT or RESX/Y is required.

   **HEIGHT=output_height:** Height in pixels of map picture.  One of
   WIDTH/HEIGHT or RESX/Y is required.
   
   **RESX=x:** When requesting a georectified grid coverage, this
   requests a subset with a specific spatial resolution.  One of
   WIDTH/HEIGHT or RESX/Y is required.

   **RESY=y:** When requesting a georectified grid coverage, this
   requests a subset with a specific spatial resolution.  One of
   WIDTH/HEIGHT or RESX/Y is required.
   
   **FORMAT=output_format:** Output format of map, as stated in the
   DescribeCoverage response.
   
The following are optional GetCoverage parameters according to the WCS
spec:

   **RESPONSE_CRS=epsg_code:** Coordinate Reference System in which to
   express coverage responses.
   
So to follow our above examples, a valid DescribeCoverage request
would look like:

::

  http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=mywcs.map&SERVICE=WCS
    &VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCoverage&coverage=bathymetry
    &CRS=EPSG:3978&BBOX=-2200000,-712631,3072800,3840000&WIDTH=3199
    &HEIGHT=2833&FORMAT=GTiff

Here is a working example of a GetCoverage request (note that a 350KB
tif is being requested, so this may take a second):

`WCS GetCoverage live example`_
        
.. index:: 
   single: WCS 1.1.0

WCS 1.1.0+ Issues
=================

WCS 1.1.0 and later versions of the WCS protocol are supported by
MapServer 5.2.  For the most part the map file setup for WCS 1.1.0 is
similar to WCS 1.0.0, but the actual protocol is substantially
changed.

GetCapabilities
---------------

The GetCapabilities request is the same as WCS 1.0 but with a
different VERSION value::

   SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.1.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

The format of the returned capabilities document is substantially
altered from WCS 1.0, and makes use of OWS Common for service
descriptions.


DescribeCoverage
----------------

The DescribeCoverage request is similar to WCS 1.0, but the IDENTIFIERS
keyword is used instead of COVERAGE to name the coverage(s) being
requested::

  SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.1.0&REQUEST=DescribeCoverage&IDENTIFIERS=spaceimaging


GetCoverage
-----------

The format for GetCoverage is substantially changed from 1.0.  The
following is a list of GetCoverage required parameters:

   **VERSION=version:** Request version

   **REQUEST=GetCoverage:** Request name

   **IDENTIFIER=coverage_name:** Name of an available coverage, as
   stated in the GetCapabilities

   **BOUNDINGBOX=minx,miny,maxx,maxy,crs:** Bounding box corners
   (lower left, upper right), and the CRS they are in.  The CRS is
   described using a URN.
   
   **FORMAT=output_format:** Output format (mime type) of grid
   product, as stated in the GetCapabilities.

If an alternate spatial resolution is desired, then the following set
of keywords must be used to specify the sample origin and step size of
the output grid to be produced.  The produced grid will be of a number
of pixels and lines as can be fit in the BOUNDINGBOX starting at
GridOrigin, at GridOffsets resolution.

   **GRIDBASECRS=crs:** The grid base CRS (URN). 

   **GRIDCS=crs:** The grid CRS (URN).

   **GridType=urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridIn2dCrs:** This is the
   only supported value for MapServer.

   **GridOrigin=x_origin,y_origin:** The sample point for the top left
   pixel.

   **GridOffsets=xstep,ystep:** The x and y step size for grid
   sampling (resolution). Both are positive.

As well, the following optional parameters are available.

   **RangeSubset=selection:** Selects a range subset, and
   interpolation method.  Currently only subsetting on bands are
   allowed.  Depending on rangeset names, this might take the form
   "BandsName[bands[1]]" to select band 1, or
   "BandsName:bilinear[bands[1]]" to select band 1 with bilinear
   interpolation.

So a simple GetCoverage might look like::

  SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.1.0&REQUEST=GetCoverage&IDENTIFIER=dem&FORMAT=image/tiff
    &BOUNDINGBOX=43,33,44,34,urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326

A more complex request might look like::

  SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.1.0&REQUEST=GetCoverage&IDENTIFIER=dem&FORMAT=image/tiff
    &BOUNDINGBOX=33,43,34,44,urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326
    &GridBaseCRS=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326&GridCS=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326
    &GridType=urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridIn2dCrs
    &GridOrigin=33,44&GridOffsets=0.01,0.01
    &RangeSubset=BandsName:bilinear[bands[1]]

It should also be noted that return results from WCS 1.1 GetCoverage
requests are in multi-part mime format.  Typically this consists of a
first part with an xml document referencing the other parts of the
message, and an image file part.  However, for output formats that
return multiple files, each will be a separate part.  For instance,
this means it is possible to return a jpeg file with a world file, the
OUTPUTFORMAT is appropriately configured.

URNs
----

In WCS 1.1 protocol coordinate systems are referenced by URN.  Some
typical URNs are::

  urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326
  urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:27700
  urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC::CRS84

The first two are roughly equivalent to EPSG:4326, and EPSG:27700
while the third is a CRS defined by OGC (essentially WGS84).  One
critical thing to note is that WCS 1.1 follows EPSG defined axis/tuple
ordering for geographic coordinate systems.  This means that
coordinates reported, or provided in urn:ogc:def:EPSG::4326 (WGS84)
are actually handled as lat, long, not long,lat.  So, for instance the
BOUNDINGBOX for an area in California might look like::

  BOUNDINGBOX=34,-117,35,-116,urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326

And, likewise the bounds reported by GetCapabilities, and
DescribeCoverage will be in this ordering as appropriate.

   single: WCS 2.0

WCS 2.0 
=======

Overview
--------

Version 6.0 introduces support for the new version 2.0 of the WCS
specification. This section documents the usage of the new WCS
version.

Web Coverage Service (WCS) 2.0 Interface Standard
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

This specification adopts the new OGC Core and Extension model and at
the moment the following documents are available from the `OGC'c WCS
Standard page`_:

* `GML 3.2.1 Application Schema Coverages`_
* `WCS 2.0 Specification - Core`_
* `WCS 2.0 Specification - KVP Protocol Binding Extension`_
* `WCS 2.0 Specification - XML/POST Protocol Binding Extension`_
* `WCS 2.0 Specification - Interpolation Extension`_
* `WCS 2.0 Specification - Range Subsetting Extension`_
* `WCS 2.0 Specification - GeoTIFF Coverage Encoding Profile`_
* `WCS 2.0 Specification - CRS Extension`_
* `WCS 2.0 Specification - Scaling Extension`_

Technical changes from WCS version 1.1.2 include entirely building on
the `GML 3.2.1 Application Schema Coverages`_ and adoption of `OWS
Common 2.0`_. Another major change is the introduction of trim and
slice concepts which is explained in more detail below.

There are `WCS 2.0 Schemas`_ defined against which all requests and
responses should validate.

WCS 2.0 KVP request parameters
``````````````````````````````

The following KVP request parameters are available in WCS 2.0:

    **COVERAGEID=id**: This parameter is technically the same as the
    **COVERAGE** parameter for WCS 1.0 or the **IDENTIFIER** parameter
    **for WCS 1.1**. In DescribeCoverage requests, multiple IDs can be
    requested by concatenating them with commas.

    **SUBSET=axis[,crs](low,high):** This parameter subsets the
    coverage on the given axis. This parameter can be given multiple
    times, but only once for each axis. The optional sub-parameter **crs** can 
    either be an EPSG definition (like EPSG:4326), an URN or an URI or
    'imageCRS' (which is the default). All **crs** sub-parameters from all
    **SUBSET** parameters must be equal. (e.g: you cannot subset one
    axis in imageCRS and another in EPSG:4326).
    
    .. note::

      The syntax of the **crs** sub-parameter is non-standard and deprecated.
      Please use the *SUBSETTINGCRS* parameter instead.

    .. note::

      Recognized values for the axis sub-parameter are: "x", "xaxis",
      "x-axis", "x_axis", "long", "long_axis", "long-axis", "lon",
      "lon_axis", "lon-axis", "y", "yaxis", "y-axis", "y_axis", "lat",
      "lat_axis" and "lat-axis".

    **SUBSETTINGCRS=crs:** This parameter defines the crs subsetting all 
    *SUBSETs* are expressed in, and also the output CRS if no *OUTPUTCRS* is 
    specified. By default all subsets are interpreted to be relative to
    the coverages CRS.
    
    **OUTPUTCRS=crs:** This parameter defines in which crs the output 
    image should be expressed in. 

    **MEDIATYPE=mediatype:** This parameter is relevant to GetCoverage
    requests, when multipart XML/image output is desired. It should be
    set to 'multipart/related' (which is currently the only possible
    value for this parameter).

    **SCALEFACTOR=factor:** With this parameter (a positive float) the size of
    the output image can be adjusted. All axes are scaled equally.

    **SCALEAXES=axis(value)[,axis(value)]:** With this parameter, an axis 
    specific scaling can be applied. Any axis not mentioned

    **SCALESIZE=axis(size)[,axis(size)]:** This is similar to the *SCALEAXES* 
    parameter, but allows an axis specific setting of the absolute pixel size
    of the returned coverage.

    **SCALEEXTENT=axis(min:max)[,axis(min:max)]:** This parameter is treated
    like a *SCALESIZE* parameter with "axis(max-min)".
    
    **INTERPOLATION=interpolation_method:** This defines the
    interpolation method used, for rescaled images. Possible values
    are "NEAREST", "BILINEAR" and "AVERAGE".

    **RANGESUBSET=band1[,band2[,...]]:** With this parameter, a
    selection of bands can be made. Also the bands can be
    reordered.  The bands can be referred to either by name (which can
    be retrieved using the DescribeCoverage request) or by index
    (starting with '1' for the first band). Also a range of bands can be given:
    *bandX:bandY*. This also includes the lower and upper bounds. As the name
    implies, the lower bound must reference the band with the lower index. You 
    can mix direct references to the bands with intervals. E.g: 
    *RANGESUBSET=band1,band3:band:5,band7*


The following parameters are part of the
`WCS 2.0 Specification - GeoTIFF Coverage Encoding Profile`_ and are only 
available for the GeoTIFF outputformat:

    **GEOTIFF:COMPRESSION=compression:** The compression method used for the 
    returned image. Valid options are: None, PackBits, Deflate, Huffman, LZW 
    and JPEG.

    **GEOTIFF:JPEG_QUALITY=1-100:** When the compression method JPEG is chosen,
    this value defines the quality of the algorithm.

    **GEOTIFF:PREDICTOR=None|Horizontal|FloatingPoint:** The predictor value 
    for the LZW and Deflate compression methods.

    **GEOTIFF:INTERLEAVE=Band|Pixel:** Defines whether the image shall be band 
    or pixel interleaved.

    **GEOTIFF:TILING=true|false:** Defines if the output image shall be 
    internally tiled.

    **GEOTIFF:TILEWIDTH=tilewidth**, **GEOTIFF:TILEHEIGHT=tileheight**: Define
    the size of the internal tiles. Must be positive integer divisible by 16.


The following request parameters are not part of the WCS 2.0 Core or any 
extension thereof, and are kept for backward compatibility. They originate from
a time where the most vital standard extensions were not specified and the WCS 
core was not quite useful without. They are deprecated.

    **SIZE=axis(value):** This parameter sets the size of the desired
    axis to the desired value (pixels).

    **RESOLUTION=axis(value):** This parameter sets the resolution of
    the desired axis to the desired value (pixels/unit).
    
    .. note::

      The **SIZE** and **RESOLUTION** are mutually exclusive on one
      axis, but can be mixed on different axes (e.g: SIZE on x-axis
      and RESOLUTION on y-axis). Also axis names in **SUBSET**,
      **SIZE** and **RESOLUTION** parameters cannot be mixed. E.g:
      ...&SUBSET=x(0,100)&SIZE=lon(200)&... is not legal although the
      axis names logically refer to the same axis.


Unchanged KVP parameters
''''''''''''''''''''''''

The following parameters have not (or just slightly) changed since the 
last version of the WCS standard.

    **VERSION=version:** For WCS 2.0, this should be set to '2.0.1'. This 
      parameter is deprecated for GetCapabilities related to OGC Web Services 
      Common Standard 2.0.0.
    
    **SERVICE=service**
    
    **REQUEST=request**
    
    **ACCEPTVERSIONS=versions**
    
    **SECTIONS=sections**
    
    **UPDATESEQUENCE=updatesequence**
    
    **ACCEPTFORMATS=formats:** This parameter is currently ignored.
    
    **ACCEPTLANGUAGES=languages:** This is used for language negotiation for
    multi-lingual services
    
    **FORMAT=format:** The desired format can now also be set with the
    name of the outputformat object defined in the mapfile. In
    contrast to previous versions of WCS this parameter is optional
    when the native format is either specified or can be determined
    via GDAL.
    
    **MAP=mapfile**

Changes to previous versions
----------------------------

The layer name must be a valid NCName, i.e: must not start with a
number and can only contain alphanumerical characters. This constraint
derives of the gml:id property which has to be a NCName, that relates
to the coverage ID which is itself taken from the layers name.

Specifying coverage specific metadata
-------------------------------------

For WCS enabled layers in MapServer, there are different possibilities
for declaring coverage metadata for WCS 2.0.  In the simplest case,
all of the required metadata can be retrieved from the source image.

For some reason this may not be desirable, maybe because the source
image does not provide these metadata.  Not every input image format
has geospatial metadata attached.  In this case, the layer metadata
can be used to provide this information.

The convention is that once (wcs|ows)_extent and one of (wcs|ows)_size
and (wcs|ows)_resolution is set in the layer metadata, all the
coverage specific metadata will be retrieved from there.  Otherwise
the source image is queried via GDAL, if possible.

The relevant layer metadata fields are (wcs|ows)_bandcount, (wcs|ows)_imagemode,
(wcs|ows)_native_format, and all `New band related metadata entries`_.

New band related metadata entries
---------------------------------

In this section new WCS 2.0 specific layer metadata entries are 
discussed.

The following layer metadata fields can be used to return a more
detailed description for the range type of a "virtual dataset"
coverage.  A coverage is considered as a "virtual dataset" if the
(wcs|ows)_extent metadata entry and one of the (wcs|ows)_size or
(wcs|ows)_resolution metadata entries are set.

First of all, the used version of metadata has to be identified. To
identify the bands of a coverage, the following field must be
present:

  * (wcs|ows)_band_names

The type of these fields is a space delimited list of names, whereas
the count of the names has to match the "bandcount" metadata
field. These names are then used as a prefix for other metadata fields
only concerning this band. The possible metadata keys are the
following:

  * {band_name}_band_interpretation
  * {band_name}_band_uom
  * {band_name}_band_definition
  * {band_name}_band_description
  * {band_name}_interval

All values are interpreted as strings, only "interval" is interpreted 
as 2 double precision float values separated with a space.

Also default values can be configured for every key. These have the
same suffix as the band specific keys but start with (wcs|ows) instead
of the bands name:

  * (wcs|ows)_band_interpretation
  * (wcs|ows)_band_uom
  * (wcs|ows)_band_definition
  * (wcs|ows)_band_description
  * (wcs|ows)_interval
  
If no specific or default value is given, the output is dependent on 
the metadata key. The UOM, for example will be set to 'W.m-2.Sr-1', 
interval and significant figures will be determined according to the 
image type and definition, description, and interpretation will not be 
visible in the output at all.

This example demonstrates the use of the band-specific metadata fields 
with their default values:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  METADATA
    "ows_srs" "EPSG:4326"
    "wcs_extent" "47.5070762077246 16.038578977182 49.0103258976982 17.2500586851354"
    
    "wcs_size" "1200 1100"
    "wcs_imagemode" "BYTE"
    
    "wcs_bandcount" "3"
    "wcs_band_names" "BandA BandB BandC"
    
    #default values
    "wcs_band_interpretation"   "This is default interpretation"
    "wcs_band_uom"              "DefaultUOM"
    "wcs_band_definition"       "DefaultDefinition"
    "wcs_band_description"      "This is default description"
    "wcs_interval"              "0 125"
    "wcs_significant_figures"   "3"
    
    #specific band values
    "BandA_band_interpretation" "This is a specific interpretation"
    "BandA_band_uom"            "SpecificUOM"
    "BandA_band_definition"     "SpecificDefinition"
    "BandA_band_description"    "This is a specific description"
    "BandA_interval"            "0 255"
  END

The above example would result in having BandA a more specific 
description, and BandB and BandC having the default description. It 
would also be possible to only use some of the specific values for 
BandA and others from the default.

If no default and specific values are given for the interval or 
significant figures metadata field, the a default is generated from the 
"imagemode" field, which itself defaults to FLOAT32.

The new metadata fields also contain the *(wcs|ows)_nilvalues* and 
*(wcs|ows)_nilvalues_reasons*

* (wcs|ows)_nilvalues

With this field, specific nilvalues can be set. The values have to be 
delimited by a space.

* (wcs|ows)_nilvalues_reasons

This field defines the reasons for the specific nilvalues. The reasons 
are also space delimited and reference the nilvalue with the same 
index. The values for the reasons should be URIs or URNs.

The following example demonstrates the use of both metadata fields:

.. code-block:: mapfile

  METADATA
    "ows_srs" "EPSG:4326"
    "wcs_extent" "47.5070762077246 16.038578977182 49.0103258976982 17.2500586851354"

    "wcs_size" "1200 1100"
    "wcs_imagemode" "BYTE"
    "wcs_bandcount" "3"

    "wcs_nilvalues" "0 255"
    "wcs_nilvalues_reasons"
      "urn:ogc:def:nil:OGC::BelowDetectionLimit urn:ogc:def:nil:OGC::AboveDetectionLimit"
  END

HTTP-POST support
=================

Since version 6.0 MapServer also supports HTTP-POST XML requests. All 
requests possible via HTTP GET can also be sent via POST. POST requests 
are possible for WCS 1.1 or WCS 2.0 which adhere to the according 
standard.

This is an example GetCapabilities request:

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <wcs:GetCapabilities
    xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/2.0
      http://schemas.opengis.net/wcs/2.0/wcsAll.xsd"
    xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/2.0"
    xmlns:wcs='http://www.opengis.net/wcs/2.0'
    xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows/2.0"
    service="WCS">

      <ows:Section>OperationsMetadata</ows:Section>
      <ows:Section>ServiceIdentification</ows:Section>
    </ows:Sections>
  </wcs:GetCapabilities>
  
This is an example DescribeCoverage request, which is only valid for 
WCS 2.0:

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <wcs:DescribeCoverage 
    xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/2.0

.. _wcs_inspire_support:

INSPIRE download service support
================================

Since version 7.2, MapServer WCS 2.0 also supports the the INSPIRE download
service. To enable this functionality, the `wcs_inspire_capabilities` setting
must be set to either `url` or `embed`.

Please refer to the :ref:`inspire_download_service` documentation for further 
metadata options.

Multi-language support
----------------------

Part of the INSPIRE download service support is the support for multi-lingual
WCS services. With the `wcs_languages` a (comma-separated) list of language
specifiers can be set. When this is set, client and server can negotiate the
result language using the `ACCEPTLANGUAGES` parameter (or the
`<ows:AcceptLanguages>`/`<ows:Language>` tags when using XML). The first
item in the accept languages list contained in the list specified with
`wcs_languages` will be used for the resulting capabilities document

Additional information can be found in the section for
:ref:`inspire_dl_multi-language_support`.


Reference Section
=================

To avoid confusion only "wcs_*" and "ows_*" prefixed metadata entries
are evaluated in OGC WCS services. Previous versions used "wms_*"
prefixed entries as fallback which is dropped in version 6.0 in favor of
forcing explicit decisions. The module will look for the "wcs_*" and
"ows_*" metadata prefixes in this order.

The following metadata are available in the setup of the mapfile:

  coverage metadata is provided by the layer metadata only (when
  wcs_extent and wcs_size/wcs_resolution are set).  When set, WCS 2.0
  GetCoverage requests will use this format when no other format is
  specified (the format parameter is optional then).

.. index:: 
   triple: WCS; METADATA; wcs_outputformat_creationoption

**wcs_outputformat_{OUTPUTFORMATNAME}_creationoption_{OPTIONNAME}**

- *Description:* (Optional) (added in MapServer 7.2.0) To provide
  creation options in a (GDAL) output format specific and layer specific way.
  {OUTPUTFORMATNAME} should be substituted by the user with the OUTPUTFORMAT.NAME
  value of an output format allowed for the layer. And {OPTIONNAME} by a
  valid GDAL creation option valid for the OUTPUTFORMAT.DRIVER.
  
  The purpose of this metadata item is to provide creation options that depend
  on the layer,  typically to configure some metadata in the resulting raster
  file that depends on that layer (for non-layer dependent configuration options,
  OUTPUTFORMAT.FORMATOPTION should rather be used).

  For GDAL drivers that support band-specific creation output (at time of
  writing, only the GRIB  driver in GDAL 2.3.0), with a BAND_{bandnumber}_{OPTIONNAME}
  syntax for the GDAL creation option, it is also possible to use a MapServer
  metadata item named
  **wcs_outputformat_{OUTPUTFORMATNAME}_creationoption_BAND_{bandnumber}_{OPTIONNAME}**.
  bandnumber will be automatically adjusted when passed to GDAL so that the
  WCS band subsetting is properly taken into account.
  You can consult `WCS GRIB output in msautotest`_ as
  a practical example of how to configure GRIB2 WCS output (requires GDAL 2.3.0)

.. index::
   triple: WCS; METADATA; wcs_outputformat_mdi

**wcs_outputformat_{OUTPUTFORMATNAME}_mdi_{DOMAIN}_{KEY}**

- *Description:* (Optional) (added in MapServer 8.0.0) To provide
  metadata item (mdi) options in a GDAL output format specific and layer specific way.
  {OUTPUTFORMATNAME} should be substituted by the user with the OUTPUTFORMAT.NAME
  value of an output format allowed for the layer.
  {DOMAIN} is the name of a GDAL metadata domain. In general, you should use "default"
  for the default metadata domain.
  And {KEY} is the key of the GDAL metadata item.

  The purpose of this metadata item is to provide GDAL metadata that depend
  on the layer, typically to configure some metadata in the resulting raster
  file that depends on that layer.

  For GDAL drivers that support band-specific metadata (e.g GeoTIFF, netCDF),
  it is also possible to use a MapServer  metadata item named
  **wcs_outputformat_{OUTPUTFORMATNAME}_mdi_BAND_{bandnumber}_{DOMAIN}_{KEY}**.
  bandnumber will be automatically adjusted when passed to GDAL so that the
  WCS band subsetting is properly taken into account.

  netCDF output is a typical use case. For dataset level metadata, the key
  must be prefix with ``NC_GLOBAL#``

  Example::

      "wcs_outputformat_netCDF_mdi_default_NC_GLOBAL#title" "A succinct description of what is in the dataset"

  For Band metadata::

      "wcs_outputformat_netCDF_mdi_BAND_1_default_NETCDF_VARNAME" "wind"
      "wcs_outputformat_netCDF_mdi_BAND_1_default_long_name"      "wind from direction"
      "wcs_outputformat_netCDF_mdi_BAND_1_default_standard_name"  "wind_from_direction"

  NETCDF_VARNAME is a special key name recognized by the GDAL netCDF
  driver to determine the variable name. All other keys are mapped to a
  netCDF attribute belonging to the corresponding variable.

  In the special case of the DATA of the layer being a netCDF dataset and
  the output of the WCS request too, and no manual wcs_outputformat_netCDF_mdi_*
  item is defined, then MapServer will automatically forward metadata from the
  input dataset to the output file.


*Axes Descriptions* (WCS 1.x only)

MapServer allows you define a number of these for a layer. Individual
axis are identified by name when defining specific metadata
(e.g. description). All defined axes must be listed in the
rangeset_axes metadata tag so MapServer knows in advance what to
expect. A special rangeset for multiband date is automatically
generated by adding the name "bands" to the rangeset_axes list.  If
found MapServer will automatically generate metadata for the image
bands.  You may of course extend that basic support using the naming
conventions below.

.. index:: 
   triple: WCS; METADATA; wcs_rangeset_axes

**wcs_rangeset_axes**

- *Description:* (Optional) Delimited list of defined range sets.  If
  defined, you can also use the following nine metadata items, where
  *rangeset axis* matches the axis name provided in this
  *wcs_rangeset_axes* metadata:  (WCS 1.x only)

    **{rangeset axis}_semantic**

    **{rangeset axis}_refsys**

    **{rangeset axis}_refsyslabel**

    **{rangeset axis}_description**

    **{rangeset axis}_label**

.. index:: 
   triple: WCS; METADATA; wcs_srs

**wcs_srs**

  the form of: EPSG:code (e.g. EPSG:3978)

.. index:: 
   triple: WCS; METADATA; wcs_timeitem

**wcs_timeitem**

  that contains time values.

.. index:: 
   triple: WCS; METADATA; wcs_timeposition

  given coverage (i.e. "2000-11-11T11:11:11Z,2001-11-11T11:11:11Z"),
  used when advertising GetCapabilities.

Layer Metadata API
----------------------

If `wcs_metadatalink_href` is not defined, MapServer will provide a link to
the Layer Metadata API for the given layer. See the
:ref:`Layer Metadata API <layer_metadata>` documentation for more information.

Rules for handling SRS in a MapServer WCS
=========================================

TODO!

Spatio/Temporal Indexes
=======================

MapServer has long supported a method of breaking a dataset into smaller, more
manageable pieces or tiles. In this case a shapefile is used to store the
boundary of each tile, and an attribute holds the location of the actual data.
Within a MapServer mapfile the layer keywords TILEINDEX and TILEITEM are used
to activate tiling.

Consider the example where an organization wants to serve hundreds or even
thousands of MODIS scenes. Five images cover the spatial extent and each group
of five varies by date of acquisition. This turns out to be a fairly common
scenario for organizations interested in WCS, one that the existing tiling
support does not adequately address. In previous versions of MapServer a
developer would have to create one tile index and one layer definition for
each group of five images. This could result in configuration files that are
prohibitively long and difficult to manage.

In order to more efficiently support the WCS specification a new tiling scheme
has been implemented within MapServer. One that supports spatial sub-setting,
but also ad hoc sub-setting based on any attributes found within tile index.
In many cases a temporal attribute could be used, but sub-setting is not
limited to that case. The new scheme introduces the concept of tile index
layers, that is, a separate layer definition is used to describe the tile
index dataset. With this we get all the benefits of any MapServer layer, most
importantly we can apply MapServer filters to the data. Filters can be defined
at runtime using MapServer CGI, MapScript or via the WCS server interface. The
syntax for the layer using the index remains unchanged except that the value
for :ref:`TILEINDEX` refers to the index layer instead of an external shapefile.

So, looking at the example above again we can reduce our MapServer
configuration to two layer definitions, one for the tile index and one for the
imagery itself. Extracting a single dates worth of imagery is now a matter of
setting the appropriate filter within the tile index layer.

Building Spatio-Temporal Tile Indexes
-------------------------------------

Developing these tile indexes is more difficult than basic indexes simply
because there are no ready-made tools to do so. Fortunately we can leverage
existing tool available within MapServer or supporting libraries such as GDAL
by post processing their output.

Taking the above example, building an index is relatively simple task if you
are willing to roll up your sleeves and write a bit of code. First, the basic
spatial index needs to be built. The GDAL utility gdaltindex already does
this. Simply point gdaltindex at the directory containing the collection of
MODIS images and it will build a shapefile index suitable for use with
MapServer. The next step would be to add the temporal information. The pseudo
code would look something like:

- open the index .dbf file for reading

- create a new column to hold the image acquisition date

- for each image; 1) extract the image acquisition date and 2) insert it into 
  the new column
  
- close the index .dbf file

This general approach could be used for many cases. A scripting language such
as Perl, PHP or Python works well since they all have readily available
modules for manipulating .dbf files. A worst case would involve hand editing
the resulting .dbf file using a desktop tool such as Mircosoft Access or ESRI
Arcview.

WCS 2.0 Application Profile - Earth Observation (EO-WCS)
========================================================

OGC is currently discussing the adoption of an Earth Observation 
(EO) Application Profile for WCS 2.0 (EO-WCS) (see `public RFC on EO-WCS`_). 
For an implementation please refer to the Open Source project `EOxServer`_ 
which already implements this proposed EO-WCS based on MapServer.

.. _wcs_to-do:

To-do Items and Known Limitations
=================================

- MapServer does not derive all of the metadata it could from a given dataset. 
  For example, you must explicitly list time periods covered by a layer. This 
  should get better with time.

- Only spatial, simple temporal and radiometric band subsetting is possible 
  with the current implementation. Future enhancements should allow for arbitrary
  subsets based on pixel values or tile/image attributes.

- The available set of WCS 2.0 specification documents is not yet 
  complete. Thus, for some implementation details, the content of some 
  forthcoming extensions had to be anticipated based on the approaches 
  taken for WCS 1.1 and 1.0. The implementation will be adjusted as 
  soon as new specification documents become available.

- If you want to use libxml2 or its derived tools (like xmllint) for 
  validation be aware that there is a currently bug in libxml2 that 
  breaks the validation of GML 3.2.1.
