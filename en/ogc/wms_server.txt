Introduction
============

A WMS (or Web Map Server) allows for use of data from several
different servers, and enables for the creation of a network of Map
Servers from which clients can build customized maps. The following
documentation is based on the Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) `Web
Map Server Interfaces Implementation Specification v1.1.1`_.

MapServer v3.5 or more recent is required to implement WMS
features. At the time this document was written, MapServer supports
the following WMS versions: 1.0.0, 1.0.7, 1.1.0 (a.k.a. 1.0.8), 1.1.1
and 1.3.0.

This document assumes that you are already familiar with certain
aspects of MapServer:

- MapServer application development and setting up .map files.
- Familiarity with the WMS spec would be an asset. A link to the WMS
  specification document is included in the "WMS-Related Information"
  section below.

How does a WMS Work
-------------------

WMS servers interact with their clients via the HTTP protocol. In most
cases, a WMS server is a CGI program. This is also the case with
MapServer.

The WMS specification defines a number of request types, and for each
of them a set of query parameters and associated behaviors. A
WMS-compliant server MUST be able to handle at least the following 2
types of WMS requests:

1. **GetCapabilities:** return an XML document with metadata of the
   Web Map Server's information
   
2. **GetMap:** return an image of a map according to the user's needs. 

And support for the following types is optional:

1. **GetFeatureInfo:** return info about feature(s) at a query (mouse
   click) location.  MapServer supports 3 types of responses to this
   request:
         
   - text/plain output with attribute info.
         
   - text/html output using MapServer query templates (see
     :ref:`template`) specified in the :ref:`CLASS` TEMPLATE parameter
     (the filename has to have an .html extension).  The MIME type
     returned by the Class templates defaults to text/html and can be
     controlled using the metadata "wms_feature_info_mime_type".
         
   - application/vnd.ogc.gml, GML.1 or GML for GML features. 
   
2. **DescribeLayer:** return an XML description of one or more map
   layers. To execute this:

   - for vector layers: to have a valid return the user needs to setup
     wfs_onlineresource (or ows_onlineresource) metadata either at the
     map level or at the layer level (the layer level metadata is the
     one which is used if both are defined) - for raster layers: the
     metadata is wcs_onlineresource with the same logic as above.

3. **GetLegendGraphic:** returns a legend image (icon) for the
   requested layer, with label(s).  More information on this request
   can be found in the GetLegendGraphic section later in this doc.

With respect to MapServer specifically, it is the "mapserv" CGI
program that knows how to handle WMS requests. So setting up a WMS
server with MapServer involves installing the :ref:`mapserv` CGI
program and a setting up a mapfile with appropriate metadata in it.
This is covered in the rest of this document.

   pair: WMS Server; Setup

Setting Up a WMS Server Using MapServer
=======================================

Install the Required Software
-----------------------------

WMS requests are handled by the :ref:`mapserv` :ref:`CGI` program. Not
all versions of the mapserv program do include WMS support (it is
included by default when you compile together with the PROJ library),
so the first step is to check that your mapserv executable includes
WMS support. One way to verify this is to use the "-v" command-line
switch and look for "SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER".

(Unix users should refer to the :ref:`unix` document for any compiling
instructions, and Windows users might want to use `MS4W`_, which comes
ready with WMS/WFS support)

Example 1. On Unix:

::

   $ ./mapserv -v
   MapServer version 7.7-dev OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=KML SUPPORTS=PROJ 
   SUPPORTS=AGG SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=CAIRO SUPPORTS=SVG_SYMBOLS 
   SUPPORTS=RSVG SUPPORTS=ICONV SUPPORTS=FRIBIDI SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER 
   SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WFS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WFS_CLIENT 
   SUPPORTS=WCS_SERVER SUPPORTS=SOS_SERVER SUPPORTS=GEOS SUPPORTS=PBF 
   INPUT=JPEG INPUT=POSTGIS INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE

Example 2. On Windows:

::

   C:\ms4w> mapserv -v
   MapServer version 7.7.0-dev (MS4W 4.0.5) OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=KML 
   SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=AGG SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=CAIRO 
   SUPPORTS=SVG_SYMBOLS SUPPORTS=SVGCAIRO SUPPORTS=ICONV SUPPORTS=FRIBIDI 
   SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WFS_SERVER 
   SUPPORTS=WFS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WCS_SERVER SUPPORTS=SOS_SERVER 
   SUPPORTS=FASTCGI SUPPORTS=THREADS SUPPORTS=GEOS SUPPORTS=POINT_Z_M 
   SUPPORTS=PBF INPUT=JPEG INPUT=POSTGIS INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE

   pair: WMS Server; Mapfile

Setup a Mapfile For Your WMS
----------------------------

Each instance of WMS server that you setup needs to have its own
mapfile. It is just a regular MapServer mapfile in which some
parameters and some metadata entries are mandatory. Most of the
metadata is required in order to produce a valid GetCapabilities
output.

Here is the list of parameters and metadata items that usually
optional with MapServer, but are **required (or strongly recommended)
for a WMS configuration:**

**At the MAP level:**

- Map NAME
- Map PROJECTION
- Map Metadata (in the WEB Object):

  - wms_title
  - wms_onlineresource
  - wms_srs (unless PROJECTION object is defined using "init=epsg:...") 
  - wms_enable_request

**And for each LAYER:**

- Layer NAME
- Layer PROJECTION
- Layer METADATA

  - wms_title
  - wms_srs (optional since the layers inherit the map's SRS value)

- Layer STATUS

  - Layers set to STATUS DEFAULT will always be sent to the client.

  - Layers set to STATUS ON or STATUS OFF can be requested by the
    client.
- Layer TEMPLATE (required for GetFeatureInfo requests - see
  :ref:`template`)

Let's go through each of these parameters in more detail:

- **Map Name and wms_title:**

  WMS Capabilities requires a Name and a Title tag for every
  layer. The Map's NAME and wms_title metadata will be used to set the
  root layer's name and title in the GetCapabilities XML output. The
  root layer in the WMS context corresponds to the whole mapfile. You 
  can suppress the root layer's name by setting ``wms_rootlayer_name``
  to ``""``.

- **Layer Name and wms_title metadata:**

  Every individual layer needs its own unique name and title. Layer
  names are also used in GetMap and GetFeatureInfo requests to refer
  to layers that should be included in the map output and in the
  query. Layer names must start with a letter when setting up a WMS
  server (layer names should not start with a digit or have spaces in
  them).
  
- **Map PROJECTION and wms_srs metadata:**

  WMS servers have to advertise the projection in which they are able
  to serve data using EPSG projection codes (see `The EPSG web page`_
  for more background on EPSG codes). The `PROJ <https://proj.org/>`__
  library come with a table of EPSG initialization codes and allows
  users to define a projection like this:

  .. code-block:: mapfile
  
    PROJECTION
       "init=epsg:4269"
    END    
          
  (Note that "epsg" has to be in lowercase when used in the PROJ
  'init' directive.)

  If the :ref:`MAP` :ref:`PROJECTION` block is provided in the format
  "init=epsg:xxxx" then MapServer will also use this information to
  generate a <BoundingBox> tag for the top-level layer in the WMS
  capabilities document.  BoundingBox is a mandatory element of WMS
  capabilities for WMS 1.3.0 (for WMS 1.1.0 it is optional, but it is
  good practice to allow MapServer to include it when possible).

  The above is sufficient for MapServer to recognize the EPSG code and
  include it in SRS tags in the capabilities output (wms_srs metadata
  is not required in this case).  However, it is often impossible to
  find an EPSG code to match the projection of your data. In those
  cases, the "wms_srs" metadata is used to list one or more EPSG codes
  that the data can be served in, and the PROJECTION object contains
  the real PROJ definition of the data's projection.

  Here is an example of a server whose data is in a Lambert Conformal
  Conic projection (3978). Its capabilities output will advertise
  EPSG:3857 (web mercator), EPSG:4269 and EPSG:4326 projections (lat/lon), 
  but the PROJECTION object is set to the real projection that the data is in:

  .. code-block:: mapfile
  
    NAME "DEMO"
    ...

    WEB
      ...
      METADATA
        "wms_title"           "WMS Demo Server"
        "wms_onlineresource"  "http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/path/to/your-mapfile.map" #must change mapfile path
        "wms_srs"             "EPSG:3857 EPSG:4269 EPSG:4326"
      END
    END

    PROJECTION
      "init=epsg:3978"
    END
    ...
    END     

  In addition to EPSG:xxxx projections, a WMS server can advertise
  projections in the AUTO:xxxx namespace. AUTO projections 42001 to
  42005 are internally supported by MapServer. However, AUTO
  projections are useful only with smart WMS clients, since the client
  needs to define the projection parameters in the WMS requests to the
  server. For more information see Annex E of the `WMS 1.1.1
  specification`_ and section 6.5.5.2 of the same document. See also
  the FAQ on AUTO projections at the end of this document.

- **Layer PROJECTION and wms_srs metadata:**

  By default layers inherit the SRS of their parent layer (the map's
  PROJECTION in the MapServer case). For this reason it is not
  necessary (but still strongly recommended) to provide PROJECTION and
  wms_srs for every layer. If a layer PROJECTION is not provided then
  the top-level map projection will be assumed.

  Layer PROJECTION and wms_srs metadata are defined exactly the same
  way as the map's PROJECTION and wms_srs metadata.

  For vector layers, if a PROJECTION block is provided in the format
  "init=epsg:xxxx" then MapServer will also use this information to
  generate a <BoundingBox> tag for this layer in the WMS capabilities
  document. BoundingBox is a mandatory element of WMS capabilities for
  WMS 1.3.0 (for WMS 1.1.0 it is optional, but it is good practice to
  allow MapServer to include it when possible).

- **"wms_onlineresource" metadata:**

  The wms_onlineresource metadata is set in the map's web object
  metadata and specifies the URL that should be used to access your
  server. This is required for the GetCapabilities output. If
  wms_onlineresource is not provided then MapServer will try to
  provide a default one using the script name and hostname, but you
  shouldn't count on that too much. It is strongly recommended that
  you provide the wms_onlineresource metadata.

  See section 6.2.2 of the `WMS 1.1.1 specification`_ for the whole
  story about the online resource URL. Basically, what you need is a
  complete HTTP URL including the http:// prefix, hostname, script
  name, potentially a "map=" parameter, and terminated by "?" or
  "&".

  Here is a valid online resource URL:

  ::
  
    http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/path/to/your-mapfile.map" #must change mapfile path
          

  By creating a wrapper script on the server it is possible to hide
  the "map=" parameter from the URL and then your server's online
  resource URL could be something like:

  ::
  
    http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mywms?
          

  This is covered in more detail in the section "More About the Online
  Resource URL" below.
  
- **"wms_enable_request" metadata:**

  Specify which requests to enable.  If not specified, no requests
  will be enabled!  See the explanation below.


- **Configuring for GetFeatureInfo Requests:**

  You must set the layer TEMPLATE parameter for the layer to be
  queryable by GetFeatureInfo requests (see :ref:`template`).  For
  requests of type "text/html" you should also set the layer HEADER
  and FOOTER parameters.
  
  As of MapServer 4.6 you must set the *gml_\** metadata for the layer
  attributes to be served (see the Layer Object metadata in the
  Reference Section later in this document).  To include geometry,
  gml_geometries and gml_[geometry name]_type has to be specified.
  
  Here are working examples of GetFeatureInfo requests: `text/plain`_
  / `text/html`_ / `gml`_ (for gml, your browser might ask you to save
  the file, if so save it locally as a .gml file and view it in a text
  editor)
  
Test Your WMS Server
--------------------

.. _wms_capabilities:

Validate the Capabilities Metadata
**********************************

OK, now that we've got a mapfile, we have to check the XML
capabilities returned by our server to make sure nothing is missing.

Using a web browser, access your server's online resource URL to which
you add the parameters
"SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetCapabilities" to the end, e.g.

::

  http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/path/to/your-mapfile.map&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1
                                                  &REQUEST=GetCapabilities
        

Here is a working GetCapabilities request (note that the SERVICE
parameter is required for all GetCapabilities requests):

`https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetCapabilities`_

This should return a document of MIME type
application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml, so your browser is likely going to prompt
you to save the file. Save it and open it in a text editor (Emacs,
Notepad, etc.), and you will see the returned XML from the WMS server.

If you get an error message in the XML output then take necessary
actions. Common problems and solutions are listed in the FAQ at the
end of this document.

If everything went well, you should have a complete XML capabilities
document.  Search it for the word "WARNING"... MapServer inserts XML
comments starting with "<!--WARNING: " in the XML output if it detects
missing mapfile parameters or metadata items. If you notice any
warning in your XML output then you have to fix all of them before you
can register your server with a WMS client, otherwise things are
likely not going to work.

Note that when a request happens, it is passed through WMS, WFS, and
WCS in MapServer (in that order) until one of the services respond to
it.

.. index:: 
   pair: WMS; GetMap

Test With a GetMap Request
**************************

OK, now that we know that our server can produce a valid XML
GetCapabilities response we should test the GetMap request. MapServer
only checks for a few of the required GetMap parameters, so both of
the minimum MapServer parameters and a valid GetMap request will be
explained below.

The following is a list of the required GetMap parameters according to
the WMS spec:

   **VERSION=version:** Request version

   **REQUEST=GetMap:** Request name

   **LAYERS=layer_list:** Comma-separated list of one or more map
   layers. Optional if SLD parameter is present.

   **STYLES=style_list:** Comma-separated list of one rendering style
   per requested layer.  Optional if SLD parameter is present. Set
   "STYLES=" with an empty value to use default style(s). Named styles
   are also supported and are controlled by CLASS GROUP names in the
   mapfile.

   **SRS=namespace:identifier:** Spatial Reference System.

   **BBOX=minx,miny,maxx,maxy:** Bounding box corners (lower left,
   upper right) in SRS units.

   **WIDTH=output_width:** Width in pixels of map picture.

   **HEIGHT=output_height:** Height in pixels of map picture.

   **FORMAT=output_format:** Output format of map.

.. note::
    WMS Servers only advertise supported formats that are part of the
    gd / gdal libraries.

A valid example would therefore be:

::


  http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?
       map=/path/to/your-mapfile.map
       &SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1
       &REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=prov_bound&STYLES=&SRS=EPSG:4326
       &BBOX=-173.537,35.8775,-11.9603,83.8009&WIDTH=400&HEIGHT=300
       &FORMAT=image/png

Here is a working `valid request`_.

.. tip::
    Since MapServer 8.0, the *tile_map_edge_buffer* metadata can also be used in
    WMS GetMap requests, by adding the vendor-specific parameter *TILED=TRUE* 
    to your GetMap request.  
    
    .. seealso:: :ref:`tile_mode`
      
Test with a Real Client
***********************

If you have access to a WMS client, then register your new server's
online resource with it and you should be off and running.

If you don't have your own WMS client installed already, here are a
few pointers:

- MapServer itself can be used as a WMS client, see the
  :ref:`MapServer WMS Client Howto <wms_client>`.

- `QGIS`_ is a full GIS package which includes WMS client
  support. (recommended)

- `OpenJUMP`_ is a desktop GIS package which includes WMS client
  support.

- `uDig`_ is a desktop package that allows users to add WMS layers.

- `Deegree`_ provides a WMS client.
  
This list is not exhaustive, there are several Open Source or
proprietary packages that offer WMS support and could be used to
interact with your new MapServer WMS server instance.

.. index:: 
   pair: WMS; GetLegendGraphic

GetLegendGraphic Request
------------------------

This request returns a legend image (icon) for the specified
layer. The request will draw an icon and a label for all classes
defined on the layer. If the requested layername is a GROUP-name, all
included layers will be returned in the legend-icon.

Requirements
************

The following are required in the WMS server mapfile to enable this
GetLegendGraphic request:

- a LEGEND object.
- a CLASS object for each layer.
- a NAME in the CLASS object.
- the STATUS of each LAYER must be set to ON. 

Parameters
**********

The following are valid parameters for this GetLegendGraphic request:

  - **LAYER** - (Required) Name of the WMS layer to return the legend
    image of.  Note that this is the <Name> parameter of the Layer in
    the GetCapabilities.

  - **FORMAT** - (Required) Format of the legend image
    (e.g. "image/png").

  - **WIDTH** - (Optional) Width of the legend image. Note that the
    Width parameter is only used when the Rule parameter is also used
    in the request.

  - **HEIGHT** - (Optional) Height of the legend image. Note that the
    Height parameter is only used when the Rule parameter is also used
    in the request.

  - **SLD** - (Optional) The URL to the SLD. Applies the SLD on the
    layer and the legend is drawn after the SLD is applied (using the
    classes specified by the SLD). Note here that you need to put a
    <Name>class1</Name> inside the Rule element so that a class name
    is created from the SLD and therefore a correct legend image.

  - **SLD_BODY** - (Optional) The body (code) of the SLD, instead of
    specifying a URL (as in the 'SLD' parameter).

  - **SLD_VERSION** - (Optional) The SLD version.

  - **SCALE** - (Optional) Specify a scale so that only layers that
    fall into that scale will have a legend.

  - **STYLE** - (Optional) The style.

  - **RULE** - (Optional) Specify the name of the CLASS to generate
    the legend image for (as opposed to generating an icon and label
    for ALL classes for the layer).

.. note:: 

    All rules that are used to draw the legend in normal CGI mode
    apply here.  See the :ref:`CGI Reference doc <cgi>` if necessary.

The :ref:`CLASS` object's KEYIMAGE parameter can also be used to
specify a legend image for a CLASS. See the :ref:`MapFile Reference
doc <mapfile>` if necessary. Example Request

An example request might look like:

::


  http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/path/to/your-mapfile.map&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&layer=park&
  REQUEST=getlegendgraphic&FORMAT=image/png            

.. index::
   pair: URL; Change

Content Dependent Legends
*************************

Support for content dependent legends is supported (since the `MapServer 6.4` release) 
for WMS GetLegendGraphic calls on POINT, LINE and POLYGON layers, when the client
includes the (non-standard) BBOX, SRS/CRS and WIDTH/HEIGHT parameters in the request URL
(such as a GetMap request). If these parameters are not present, the
normal legend rendering will occur.  For more information, please see :ref:`rfc101`.

.. _online_resource_wms:

Changing the Online Resource URL
================================

As mentioned in the section "Setup a Mapfile / wms_onlineresource
metadata" above, the following Online Resource URL is perfectly valid
for a MapServer WMS according to section 6.2.2 or the WMS 1.1.1
specification:

::

  http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/path/to/your-mapfile.map
      
However, some people will argue that the above URL contains mandatory
vendor-specific parameters and that this is illegal. First we would
like to point that "map=..." is not considered a vendor-specific
parameter in this case since it is part of the Online Resource URL
which is defined as an opaque string terminated by "?" or "&" (See
`WMS 1.1.1 section 6.2.2`_).

.. NOTE::
   It is strongly recommended to review the security steps for the *MAP=*
   call to the MapServer executable, by setting *MS_MAP_PATTERN* or 
   *MS_MAP_NO_PATH* or hiding the *MAP=* parameter on public servers, 
   as recommended in the document :ref:`limit_mapfile_access`. All possible
   environment variables to secure your server are listed in :ref:`environment_variables`.

But anyway, even if it's valid, the above URL is still ugly. And you
might want to use a nicer URL for your WMS Online Resource URL. Here
are some suggestions:

.. index::
   pair: Apache; ReWriteRule

Apache ReWrite rules (using Apache mod_rewrite)
-----------------------------------------------

One can use Apache's mod_rewrite to avoid specifying the map, or any
other default parameter in the mapserver URL.  This task consist of
three steps, specifying the mod_rewrite module to be loaded, enabling
the mod_rewrite module for the selected directories and at last to
write a .htaccess file to do the rewriting.

In the httpd.conf file, the mod_rewrite module is per default
disabled.  To enable it, remove the opening # in the line

::

  #LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

To be able to use the module, it must be enabled, using the directive
AllowOverride. This can be done per server or per directory. If you
just have one server, add an "AllowOverride All" line in the
httpd.conf file (see the Apache documentation to be sure about the
security implications of this).  Per directory is the easiest way to
make it work on virtual hosts.  Within the <virtualHost> section of
the httpd.conf insert:

::

  <Directory myhtdocsdir>
    AllowOverride All
  </Directory>

Where myhtdocsdir is the directory defined as documentroot for the
actual virtual server.

When the directives are set to load and enable the mod_rewrite module,
Apache has to be restarted.

In a web-accessible directory make a .htaccess file like the
following:

::

  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule wmsmap?(.*) /cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/www/mapserverstuff/mymapfile.map&$1

The rewriteRule says: given a webpage starting with wmsmap, pick out
the query parameters, make a new page request starting with
/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=(…)? and add on whatever was the query
parameters in the original page request.

e.g, the URL wmsmap?mode=map will be rewritten as

::
  /cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/www/mapserverstuff/mymapfile.map&mode=map

If just the URL wmsmap is given (without any parameters) a page not
found error will show up as that does not match the wmsmap?
expression.

.. index::
   pair: Apache; MS_MAPFILE

Apache environment variables - MS_MAPFILE
-----------------------------------------

A default mapfile can be specified using the MS_MAPFILE environment
variable:

::

   Alias /mywms /usr/lib/cgi-bin/mapserver
   <Location /mywms>
      SetHandler cgi-script
      Options ExecCGI
      SetEnv MS_MAPFILE /path/to/mymapfile.map
   </Location>


.. index::
   pair: Apache; SetEnvIf

Apache SetEnvIf
---------------

Another option is to use the "setenvif" feature of Apache: use
symbolic links that all point to a same mapserv binary, and then for
each symbolic link test the URL, and set the MAP environment
accordingly.

For Windows and Apache users the steps are as follows (this requires
Apache 1.3 or newer):

- Copy mapserv.exe to a new name for your WMS, such as "mywms.exe".
- In httpd.conf, add:

::
   
   SetEnvIf Request_URI "/cgi-bin/mywms" MS_MAPFILE=/path/to/mymap.map
              
.. index::
   pair: IIS; ASP script

ASP script (IIS - Microsoft Windows)
------------------------------------

On IIS servers (Windows), you can use the following ASP script:
      
.. note:: The script below, while functional, is intended only as an
   example of using ASP to filter MapServer requests. Using ASP in a
   production WMS server will likely require additional ASP especially
   in the area of error handling and setting timeouts.*

.. code-block:: aspx-vb
   
   <%
     Server.ScriptTimeout = 360

     Select Case Request.ServerVariables("REQUEST_METHOD")
       Case "GET"  strRequest = Request.QueryString
       Case "POST" strRequest = Request.Form
     End Select

     strURL = "http://myserver/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?
               map=C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\workshop\itasca.map&" & strRequest

     Dim objHTTP

Mapscript wrapper
-----------------

Some OGC services (WFS, SOS) support both GET and POST requests.
Here, you can use a minimal MapScript WxS wrapper.  Here's a Python
example:

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/python

   import mapscript

   req = mapscript.OWSRequest()
   req.loadParams()
   map = mapscript.mapObj('/path/to/config.map')
   map.OWSDispatch(req)

.. index::
   pair: Unix; Wrapper script

Wrapper script (Unix)
---------------------

On Unix servers, you can setup a wrapper shell script that sets the
MS_MAPFILE environment variable and then passes control to the mapserv
executable... that results on a cleaner OnlineResource URL:

::   
   
   #! /bin/sh
   MS_MAPFILE=/path/to/demo.map
   export MS_MAPFILE
   /path/to/mapserv           

.. note:: Using a /bin/sh wrapper script causes an overhead on system
   resources as two processes have to be spawned instead of one, and
   is therefore not recommended.

   single: WMS 1.3.0

WMS 1.3.0 Support
=================

MapServer 5.4 adds support for WMS 1.3.0. Although the general
mechanism in MapServer  to support this new specification are the same,
there are some notable upgrades.


Major features related to the WMS 1.3.0 support 
-----------------------------------------------
 
- Support WMS 1.3.0 basic operations: GetCapabilities, GetMap and
  GetFeatureInfo.

- Implement the `Styled Layer Descriptor profile of the Web Map
  Service Implementation Specification`_. This specification extends
  the WMS 1.3.0 and allows to advertise styling capabilities (Styled
  Layer Descriptor (SLD) support). It also defines two additional
  operations, GetLegendGraphic and DescribeLayer.

- Implement the `Symbology Encoding Implementation Specification`_,
  which is the new version of the SLD. Read support was added for
  Point, Line, Polygon, Raster symbolizers.

- Upgrade the generation of SLD to version 1.1.0 (SLD generated
  through through the GetStyles operation or through MapScript).

.. index:: 
   pair: Map projections; Axis order


Coordinate Systems and Axis Orientation  
---------------------------------------

The most notable changes introduced in WMS 1.3.0 are the:

- the axis changes
- the introduction of new coordinate reference systems
- the use of CRS parameter (instead of SRS)

The axis order in previous versions of the WMS specifications was to
always use easting (x or lon ) and northing (y or lat).  WMS 1.3.0
specifies that, depending on the particular CRS, the x axis may or may
not be oriented West-to-East, and the y axis may or may not be
oriented South-to-North. The WMS portrayal operation shall account for
axis order. This affects some of the EPSG codes that were commonly
used such as ESPG:4326.  MapServer 5.x makes sure that coordinates
passed to the server (as part of the GetMap BBOX parameter) as well as
those advertised in the capabilities document reflect the inverse axe
orders for EPSG codes between 4000 and 5000.

MapServer 6.0 and up holds a list of EPSG codes with inverted axis
order. It is currently based on EPSG database version 7.6. It is also
possible to define the axis order at build time for a specific ESPG
code (see `issue #3582 <https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues/3582>`__). 
This allows for example to use the "normal" axis
order for some of EPSG codes between 4000 and 5000.

In addition, the WMS 1.3.0 defines a series of new coordinate
system. These are the ones that are currently supported in MapServer:

- CRS:84 (WGS 84 longitude-latitude)
- CRS:83 (NAD83 longitude-latitude)
- CRS:27 (NAD27 longitude-latitude)
- AUTO2:42001 (WGS 84 / Auto UTM )
- AUTO2:42002 (WGS 84 / Auto Tr. Mercator)
- AUTO2:42003 (WGS 84 / Auto Orthographic)
- AUTO2:42004 (WGS 84 / Auto Equirectangular)
- AUTO2:42005 (WGS 84 / Auto Mollweide)

Example of requests
-------------------

Users can use the CRS:84 coordinate system and order the BBOX
coordinates as long/lat:

- ...&CRS=CRS:84&BBOX=-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0&... `(example request)
  <https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-180,-90,180,90&CRS=CRS:84&WIDTH=953&HEIGHT=480&LAYERS=bluemarble,cities&STYLES=,&FORMAT=image/png&DPI=96&TRANSPARENT=true>`__

Users can also use the ESPG:4326 coordinates and use the axis ordering
of lat/long:

- ...&EPSG:4326&BBOX=-90.0,-180.0,90,180.0&... `(example request)
  <https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-90,-180,90,180&CRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=953&HEIGHT=480&LAYERS=bluemarble,cities&STYLES=,&FORMAT=image/png&DPI=96&TRANSPARENT=true>`__


Other notable changes
---------------------

- valid values for the EXCEPTIONS parameter in a GetMap request are
  XML, INIMAGE, BLANK
- valid value for the EXCEPTIONS parameter in a GetFeatureInfo request
  is XML
- LayerLimit is introduced, allowing a server to advertise and limit
  the number of layers a client is allowed to include in a GetMap
  request

Some  Missing features 
----------------------

- WMS 1.3.0 Post request should be an XML document containing the
  different operations and parameters.

- SLD documents containing elements from the Feature Encoding 1.1
  specification could potentially use ESPG projections with some
  filters. It is not yet clear nor implemented if the axis ordering
  should be taken into account in these specific cases.


OCG compliance tests
--------------------

As of version 5.4, MapServer passes all the basic and query tests of
the OGC CITE test suite for WMS 1.3.0.

   pair: WMS; Metadata

Reference Section
=================

The following metadata are available in the setup of the mapfile:

(Note that each of the metadata below can also be referred to as
'ows\_\*' instead of 'wms\_\*'. MapServer tries the 'wms_*' metadata
first, and if not found it tries the corresponding 'ows\_\*'
name. Using this reduces the amount of duplication in mapfiles that
support multiple OGC interfaces since "ows\_\*" metadata can be used
almost everywhere for common metadata items shared by multiple OGC
interfaces.)

- *Description:*

  - Used to specify an additional MIME type that can be used when
    responding to the GetFeature request.

    For example if you want to use the layer's HTML template as a base
    for its response, you need to add "WMS_FEATURE_INFO_MIME_TYPE"
    "text/html".  Setting this will have the effect of advertising
    text/html as one of the MIME types supported for a GetFeature
    request. You also need to make sure that the layer points to a
    valid html template (see :ref:`template`).  The client can then
    call the server with INFO_FORMAT=text/html.

**gml_exclude_items**

- *Description:* (Optional, applies only to GetFeatureInfo GML
  requests) A comma delimited list of items to exclude. As of
  MapServer 4.6, you can control how many attributes (fields) you
  expose for your data layer with metadata. The previous behaviour was
  simply to expose all attributes all of the time. The default is to
  expose no attributes at all. An example excluding a specific field
  would be:

**gml_include_items**

- *Description:* (Optional, applies only to GetFeatureInfo GML
  requests) A comma delimited list of items to include, or keyword
  "all". As of MapServer 4.6, you can control how many attributes
  (fields) you expose for your data layer with this metadata. The
  previous behaviour was simply to expose all attributes all of the
  time. You can enable full exposure by using the keyword "all", such
  as:
  
  .. code-block:: mapfile
  
    "gml_include_items" "all"
    
  You can specify a list of attributes (fields) for partial exposure,
  such as:
  
  .. code-block:: mapfile
  
    "gml_include_items" "Name,ID"
    
  The new default behaviour is to expose no attributes at all.

    Time and DateTime have been added in MapServer 8. And since MapServer 8,
    Date semantics is a date, without time, whereas in previous versions, it
    was used indifferently for Date, Time or DateTime.

- *Description:* Space separated list of requests to enable.
  The default is none.
  The following requests can be enabled:
  `GetCapabilities`, `GetMap`, `GetFeatureInfo` and
  `GetLegendGraphic`.  A "!" in front of a request will disable the
  request. "*" enables all requests.

- *Examples:*

  To enable only `GetMap` and `GetFeatureInfo`:

  ::

    "wms_enable_request" "GetMap GetFeatureInfo"

  To enable all requests except `GetFeatureInfo`

.. index:: 
   triple: WMS; METADATA; wms_extent

**wms_extent**

- *WMS TAG Name:* BoundingBox (WMS1.1.1, sect. 6.5.6)
- *Description:* (Optional) Used for the layer's BoundingBox tag for
  cases where it is impossible (or very inefficient) for MapServer to
  probe the data source to figure its extents. The value for this
  metadata is "minx miny maxx maxy" separated by spaces, with the
  values in the layer's projection units.  If wms_extent is provided
  then it has priority and MapServer will NOT try to read the source
  file's extents.

  For Rasters served through WMS, MapServer can now use the wms_extent
  metadata parameter to register the image. If a .wld file cannot be
  found, MapServer will then look for the wms_extent metadata
  parameter and use the extents of the image and the size of the image
  for georegistration.

.. index:: 
   triple: WMS; METADATA; wms_group_abstract

**wms_group_abstract**

- *Description:* (Optional) A blurb of text providing more information
  about the group. Only one layer for the group needs to contain
  wms_group_abstract, MapServer will find and use the value. The value
  found for the first layer in the group is used. So if multiple
  layers have wms_group_abstract set then only the first value is
  used.

.. index:: 
   triple: WMS; METADATA; wms_group_title

**wms_group_title**

- *WMS TAG Name:* Group_title (WMS1.1.1, sect. 7.1.4.1)
- *Description:* (Optional) A human-readable name for the group that
  this layer belongs to. Only one layer for the group needs to contain
  wms_group_title, MapServer will find and use the value. The value
  found for the first layer in the group is used. So if multiple
  layers have wms_group_title set then only the first value is used.

.. index:: 
   triple: WMS; METADATA; wms_layer_group

**wms_layer_group**

- *Description:* (Optional) Can be used to assign a layer to a number
  of hierarchically nested groups. This grouped hierarchy will be
  expressed in the capabilities.

  From MapServer 7.2, WMS_LAYER_GROUP is similar to the GROUP keyword in that
  it always publishes the name and the tile of the group in the
  capabilities. As a consequence the groups set with WMS_LAYER_GROUP can always be
  requested with a GetMap or GetFeatureInfo request (see section
  7.1.4.5.2 of the WMS implementation specification version
  1.1.1. (OGC 01-068r2)).
  
  A difference with GROUP is that GROUP does not support nested groups.
  The purpose of this metadata setting is to enable making a WMS client aware
  of layer grouping.

  All group names should be preceded by a forward slash (/). It is not
  allowed to use both the WMS_LAYER_GROUP setting and the GROUP
  keyword for a single layer. GROUP can be seen as deprecated!

  wms_metadataurl_foo_type, wms_metadataurl_bar_href, wms_metadataurl_bar_format,
  wms_metadataurl_bar_type will be queried with the semantics of the
  wms_metadataurl_href, wms_metadataurl_format and wms_metadataurl_type items.

Layer Metadata API
----------------------

If ``wms_metadataurl_href`` is not defined, MapServer will provide a link to
the Layer Metadata API for the given layer in the ``<MetadataURL>`` element
See the :ref:`Layer Metadata API <layer_metadata>` documentation for more
information.

Vendor specific WMS parameters
------------------------------

.. index::
   triple: WMS; Vendor specific parameters; angle

**angle**

- Angle (in degrees) to rotate the map.

 .. note::
     The angle value is in degrees clockwise. 

.. index::
   triple: WMS; Vendor specific parameters; radius

**radius**

- This parameter accepts two types of input:

  - An integer that specifies the search radius in pixels.

  - The special value `bbox` that will change the query into a bbox
    query based on the bbox given in the request parameters.

**bbox_pixel_is_point**

- If this parameter is "TRUE", MapServer will treat the BBOX received in WMS
  GetMap requests as if it was provided in pixel_is_point mode. Essentially
  disabling the conversion from pixel_is_area (WMS model) to pixel_is_point that
  is present in mapwms.c for that specific mapfile.
   
.. index::
   pair: WMS; Cascading requests

Cascading WMS Requests
----------------------

Currently, there are 3 requests that support WMS cascading:

- GetMap

- GetFeatureInfo

- GetLegendGraphic

  Before MapServer 6.2, a GetLegendGraphic request was not cascaded. A
  legend was returned using the layer classes. To preserve that
  behavior, a GetLegendGraphic request will be cascaded only **if**:

  1. The GetLegendGraphic request is enabled via the *_enable_request*
     metadata.

  2. The layer does not contain any class with the name property
     set. ie:

  .. code-block:: mapfile

     CLASS
       NAME "Parks"
       STYLE
         COLOR 0 255 0
       END
     END

  This layer won't be cascaded because it contains at least a class
  with the property NAME set.

.. note::

   If you know that the remote WMS server *does not* support a given
   WMS request, you should disable this request explicitly for your
   layer using the (ows/wms)_enable_request metadata. Otherwise, you
   will simply get the XML exception from the cascaded server.

FAQ / Common Problems
=====================

:Q: **How can I find the EPSG code for my data's projection?**

:A: If you know some of the parameters of your data's projection, 
    then you can use the search tool at https://epsg.io/ to find your data's 
    associated EPSG code. The EPSG official home now also allows
    you to perform a text or map search for a projection: https://epsg.org/
    
    For `PROJ <https://proj.org/>`_ version >= 6: the EPSG codes are stored in a SpatiaLite
    database *proj.db* usually located in /usr/local/share/proj/ on
    Unix systems and in C:/PROJ/ or C:/PROJ/NAD in Windows systems
    (depending on the installation), specifically /MS4W/proj/nad/ for MS4W
    users.    
    
    For `PROJ <https://proj.org/>`_ version < 6: you can browse the "epsg" file that comes 
    with PROJ and look for a projection definition that matches your data's 
    projection. It's a simple text file and the EPSG code is inside 
    brackets (<...>) at the beginning of every line. The "epsg" file is 
    usually located in /usr/local/share/proj/ on
    Unix systems and in C:/PROJ/ or C:/PROJ/NAD in Windows systems
    (depending on the installation).  MS4W users will find the epsg
    file in /MS4W/proj/nad/.
 
--------------
 
:Q: **My WMS server produces the error "msProcessProjection(): no
    system list, errno: .."**

:A: That's likely PROJ complaining that it cannot find the *epsg*
    projection definition file (for PROJ version < 6), or the *proj.db* file
    (for PROJ version >= 6). Make sure you have installed `PROJ <https://proj.org/>`_
    and that the *proj.db* file (or *epsg* depending on
    your local PROJ version) is installed at the
    right location. On Unix it should be under /usr/local/share/proj/,
    and on Windows PROJ looks for it under C:/PROJ/ or C:/PROJ/NAD
    (depending on the installation), MS4W users will find the file in 
    /MS4W/proj/nad/.  You should also check the
    :ref:`error documentation <errors>` to see if your exact error is
    discussed.

    If you don't have the *proj.db* file (or *epsg* file) then you can 
    get it as part of the PROJ distribution at `https://proj.org/`_ 
    Alternatively, you can manually download the PROJ < 6 *epsg* file 
    at `http://www.maptools.org/dl/proj4-epsg.zip`_.

:Q: **How do AUTO projections work?**

:A: When a WMS client calls a WMS server with an auto projection, it
    has to specify the SRS in the form: AUTO:
    proj_id,unit_id,lon0,lat0 where:

    - proj_id is one of 42001, 42002, 42003, 42004, or 42005 (only
      five auto projections are currently defined).
    - unit_id is always 9001 for meters. (It is uncertain whether
      anyone supports any other units.)
    - lon0 and lat0 are the coordinates to use as the origin for the
      projection.

    When using an AUTO projection in WMS GetCapabilities, you include
    only the "AUTO:42003" string in your wms_srs metadata, you do not
    include the projection parameters. Those are added by the
    application (client) at runtime depending on the map view. For
    example:

    .. code-block:: mapfile
 
       NAME "DEMO" 
       ... 

       WEB 
         ... 
         METADATA 
           "wms_title"            "WMS Demo Server" 
           "wms_onlineresource"   "http://my.host.com/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/path/to/your-mapfile.map" #must change mapfile path
           "wms_srs"              "AUTO:42001 AUTO:42002" 
           "wms_enable_request" "*"   ##necessary
         END # METADATA
       END # WEB
              

    The above server advertises the first two auto projections.
