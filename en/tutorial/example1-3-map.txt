    # MapServer map file uses the pound sign (#) to denote the start of a line
    # comment--each line that needs to be commented has to be prepended with a "#".
    #
    # Map files begin with MAP keyword to signify the start of the map object.
    # Well, the entire map file is THE map object.  Enclosed between MAP and END
    # at the very bottom of this map file, are keyword/value pairs and other
    # objects.

        # separate a layer into classes.  This attribute will be in the DBF file
        # of your shapefile (it will be different for each data format).  In this
        # example the shapefile states_ugl has an associated database 
        # (states_ugl.dbf) that contains an attribute called "CLASS".  You will be
        # using two values in the CLASS attribute to separate the classes (also 
        # called themes) used in this layer--land and water.  CLASSITEM is used in
