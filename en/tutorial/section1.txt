Section 1: Static Maps and the MapFile
======================================

- Take a shapefile. Any shapefile. We can use MapServer to display
  that shapefile on a web browser. Look...

    - :ref:`Example 1.1 - A map with a single layer <example1-1>`
  
- We can display the same shapefile repeatedly. We can display the
  polygon attributes on one LAYER and the line attributes on
  another...

    - :ref:`Example 1.2 - A map with two layers <example1-2>`

- And we can select which parts of the shapefile to display. We do
  this using the CLASS object...

    - :ref:`Example 1.3 - Using classes to make a "useful" map <example1-3>`

- We can also label our maps...

    - :ref:`Example 1.4 - Labeling layers and label layers <example1-4>`

- Or add raster data such as satellite images, aerial photographs, or
  shaded reliefs...

    - :ref:`Example 1.5 - Adding a raster layer <example1-5>`

- We can reproject our data from just about any projection to just
  about any... Yeah, check it out!

    - :ref:`Example 1.6 - Projection/Reprojection <example1-6`

- And we can use layers from other map servers on the internet (as
  long as they are WMS servers)...

    - :ref:`Example 1.7 - Adding a WMS layer <example1-7>`

- MapServer can output to various formats such as PDF and GeoTIFF.

    - :ref:`Example 1.8 - A different output format <example1-8>`

- MapServer not only generates static maps, it can also create
  interactive maps...
