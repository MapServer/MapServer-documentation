Section 1: Static Maps and the MapFile
======================================

- Take a vector dataset. Any vector datatype supported by `GDAL <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/>`__.  We can use
  MapServer to display that vector dataset in a web
  browser. Look...

  - :ref:`Example 1.1 - A map with a single layer <example1-1>`
  
- We can display the same Shapefile dataset repeatedly. We can display
  the polygon attributes in one LAYER and the line attributes in
  another...

  - :ref:`Example 1.2 - A map with two layers <example1-2>`

- And we can select which parts of the Shapefile dataset to
  display. We do this using the CLASS object...

  - :ref:`Example 1.3 - Using classes to make a "useful" map <example1-3>`

- We can also label our maps...

  - :ref:`Example 1.4 - Labeling layers and label layers <example1-4>`

- Or add raster data such as satellite images, aerial photographs, or
  shaded reliefs...

  - :ref:`Example 1.5 - Adding a raster layer <example1-5>`

- We can reproject our data from just about any projection to just
  about any... Yeah, check it out!

  - :ref:`Example 1.6 - Projection/Reprojection <example1-6>`

- And we can use layers from other map servers on the Internet (for
  example WMS servers)...

  - :ref:`Example 1.7 - Adding a WMS layer <example1-7>`

- MapServer can output to various formats such as PDF and GeoTIFF.

  - :ref:`Example 1.8 - A different output format <example1-8>`

- MapServer not only generates static maps, it can also create
  interactive maps...

  - `Example 1.9 - The difference between map mode and browse mode <https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/mapserver/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-9.map&layer=states&layer=modis&program=https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/mapserv>`_
