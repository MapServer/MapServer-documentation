    # MapServer map file uses the pound sign (#) to denote the start of a line
    # comment--each line that needs to be commented has to be prepended with a "#".
    #
    # Map files begin with MAP keyword to signify the start of the map object.
    # Well, the entire map file is THE map object.  Enclosed between MAP and END
    # at the very bottom of this map file, are keyword/value pairs and other
    # objects.

        # CLASSITEM defines the non-spatial attribute that you will be using to
        # separate a layer into classes.  This attribute will be in the DBF file
        # of your shapefile (it will be different for each data format).  In this
        # example the shapefile states_ugl has an associated database 
        # (states_ugl.dbf) that contains an attribute called "CLASS".  You will be
        # using two values in the CLASS attribute to separate the classes (also 
        # called themes) used in this layer--land and water.  CLASSITEM is used in 
        # association with the EXPRESSION parameter in the CLASS object.  See below.
        CLASSITEM    "CLASS"

        # Just like CLASSITEM, LABELITEM defines the database attribute that you 
        # will be using to draw labels.  In this case, the values of the attribute 
        # "STATE" will be used to label the states polygons.
        LABELITEM    "STATE"

          # just like there are layers in a map.  You can define multiple styles in
          # a class just as you can define multiple classes in a layer and multiple
          # layers in a map.

          # MapServer has a very flexible labeling system.  With that flexibility
          # comes complexity, specially when using truetype fonts.  Please read
