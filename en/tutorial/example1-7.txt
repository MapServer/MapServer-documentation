Adding OGC WMS Layers
---------------------

.. image::  https://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/mapserver/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-7.map&layers=states+modis_nasa&mode=map

Another exciting feature of MapServer is its ability to use layers from other
map servers. In this case, a MapServer application becomes a WMS (or WFS)
client. MapServer can also share (or serve up) the layers in the mapfile to
other map servers. This makes an application a WMS (or WFS) server. What is WMS
or WFS? These are "web-based interoperability service" specifications published
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). WMS stands for Web Map Service and WFS
for Web Feature Service. The difference between these two specifications, in
simple terms, is that WMS uses web raster formats (PNG, GIF, JPEG) to share
layers while WFS uses GML, the Geography Markup Language. A third OGC
interoperability specification is the Web Coverage Services specification or
WCS.  MapServer supports WCS at the server level only. To find more information
about WMS, WFS, and WCS go the the `OGC's web site
<https://www.ogc.org>`_ and look for the `OGC Implementation
Specifications <https://www.ogc.org/docs/is>`_ or `OGC
Abstract Specifications <https://www.ogc.org/docs/as>`_.
The MapServer web site also has :ref:`documentation <ogc>` and `WIKI pages
<https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/wiki>`_ for these specifications.

This example shows you how to add a WMS layer in your mapfile.

The MapFile
###########

This is what the mapfile looks like: :ref:`Example1-7.map <example1-7-map>`

LAYER Object and WMS Parameters
*******************************

Let's have a look at the WMS layer:

**LAYER # MODIS WMS map from NASA**
   Marks the start of the WMS LAYER object.

**NAME modis_nasa**
   The LAYER identifier.

**TYPE RASTER**
   Since this the WMS layer is an image, we use RASTER as LAYER TYPE.

**OFFSITE 0 0 0**
   Ignore the black background color

**STATUS OFF**
   Turn this layer off by default.

**CONNECTIONTYPE WMS**
   The type of LAYER connection to use. The default is LOCAL.

   .. note::

      If we have to be explicit, we would add CONNECTIONTYPE LOCAL to
      all othe vector and raster layers in our mapfile. Instead we only
      define connection types that are external. WMS is an external
      data layer, coming from another map server.

**CONNECTION "https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/wms/wms?"**
   The connection string that allows us to *get* the data from another
   server. In the case of WMS connections, this is a URL.  If we were
   using a PostGIS database, it would be an SQL statement.  Please
   note that the string has to be in a single line in your mapfile.

**METADATA**
   marks the beginning of the METADATA object for our WMS layer.
   MapServer uses the parameters defined within this object along with
   the CONNECTION parameter above to form a valid WMS request to the
   WMS server.

**"wms_srs" "epsg:4326"**
   The WMS projection.  Sometimes the WMS server supports more than
   one projection.  If this is the case you might want to request the
   map in your output projection (epsg:2163).  Unfortunately, the NASA
   server doesn't support this projection.

**"wms_name" "MOD_143D_RR"**
   The WMS layer name. This is like adding the parameter "layers=modis".

**"wms_server_version" "1.1.1"**
   The WMS version the server complies to.  For more options, see
   :ref:`ogc_support`.

**"wms_format" "image/jpeg"**
   The image format we expect to be receiving from the WMS server.
   You can try replacing the value with *image/png* or something else.

**END**
   marks the end of the METADATA object

To know more about adding WMS layers to your applications, please visit the 
:ref:`MapServer WMS Client Howto <wms_client>`.

WEB Object Parameters
*********************

In addition to adding the WMS layer object, there's also a new object under MAP. This is the WEB object. Within the WEB object are two parameters:

**IMAGEPATH '/data/tmp/'**
   The absolute local path to a web accessible temporary
   directory. The user running the web server processes should be able
   to write to this directory. Make sure that the path includes a
   slash (/) at the end. (Your IMAGEPATH might look something like
   this: "/home/apache/htdocs/tmp/" or "C:/Inetpub/wwwroot/tmp/".)

**IMAGEURL '/tmp/'**
   This is how IMAGEPATH will appear relative to the web server's root
   directory. If we have to type the full URL for this, it will be
   "https://demo.mapserver.org/ms_tmp/". Make sure that the path
   includes a slash (/) at the end.

----

Finally, within the MAP object, I added a new parameter: NAME. This is
the identifier for the MAP object. MapServer uses this as prefix to
all images it creates and dumps to the *tmp* directory.  It's not
needed at this point but it also doesn't hurt to have it.

If you would like to share your data layers to other map servers, you
will need to add METADATA objects within your MAP object and within
each of the LAYER objects you would like to share. All the WMS layers
that you added from another server will automatically be cascaded and
will also become available to others. To know more about how to make
your MapServer application become a WMS server, please read the
:ref:`MapServer WMS Server HowTo <wms_server>`.  Documentation also
exists for configuring MapServer applications to support the WFS
standard, both as a :ref:`server <wfs_server>` and as a :ref:`client
<wfs_client>`.
