 .. note::

    This tutorial requires at least MapServer 7 (the `demo server <https://demo.mapserver.org>`__ 
    in the live examples runs MapServer 8.0-dev)

This tutorial (initially created in the early-2000's by Perry, and maintained 
since by Jeff) was designed to give new users a quick (relatively speaking) 
introduction to the concepts behind MapServer. It is arranged into four 
sections with each section having one or more examples and increasing in 
complexity.  Users can jump to any section at any time although it is 
recommended that absolute beginners work on the first three sections 
sequentially.

Section one focuses on basic MapServer configuration concepts such as
layer and class ordering, using vector and raster data, projections
and labeling.  Section two provides examples on how to use HTML
templates to create a simple interface for an interactive web mapping
application. Section three introduces the use of HTML templates to
provide a "query" interface. Finally, section four introduces some
advanced user interface concepts.
