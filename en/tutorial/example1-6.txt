Whoa! What happened here?

You've just experienced on-the-fly reprojection. When a PROJECTION object is 
defined in the mapfile, MapServer passes the layer and projection info to the 
Proj.4 library which does the reprojection.  For more information about the 
Proj.4 library, please visit `<http://proj.maptools.org/>`_.

This example attempts to shed some light on the projection support in MapServer.

This is what the mapfile looks like: :ref:`Example1-6.map <example1-6-map>`

The first thing you might have noticed with our mapfile is the original EXTENT 
has been commented out and the new EXTENT values don't look anything like 
latitude and longitude values. Also, we have added a PROJECTION object near the 
top and within each of our layers.

Let's have a look at the new object and parameter:

::

      EXTENT  201621.496941 -294488.285333 1425518.020722 498254.511514

The extent we provide to MapServer needs to be in the same units as the output 
projection.  Since Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area's units are in meters, we have
to give the new extent in meters.  We can calculate the new extent using 
ArcView or some other GIS package, or you can use Proj.4's cs2cs utility.  The 
command below is what can be used to reproject the original extent values:

::

  cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=laea +ellps=clrk66 +lat_0=45 +lon_0=-100

After typing the command, enter the southwestern coordinate pair (the lower 
left coordinates), separated by a space:

::

  -97.5 41.619778

to which the "cs2cs" utility gives the values:

::

  208398.01       -372335.44 0.000

I then type the northeastern coordinate pair (upper right corner coordinates), 
again separated by space: 

::

  -82.122902 49.38562

and the following values are returned:

::

  1285308.08      632638.93 0.000

You will notice that "cs2cs" returns a set of three values.  You can ignore the 
third value, 0.000, as it means to represent altitute (which we're not using).  
Anyway, we can now present the EXTENT as:

::

            EXTENT 208398.01 -372335.44 1285308.08 632638.93

But it doesn't match up the extent above, you say.  Well, that's what usually 
happens when you reproject--the map doesn't necessarily get centered as you'd 
expect.  You can fudge around it, taking a few thousand meters off to the left 
and adding a few to the right.  Or, you can use a graphical GIS package to give 
you the extent. `Here are the instructions 
<http://biometry.gis.umn.edu/tutorial/arcview_extent.html>`_
for getting EXTENT using ArcView.

MapServer can take projection definitions in two ways. The first is shown in the 
mapfile's output PROJECTION object (the first PROJECTION block). This is the 
traditional way of passing parameters to the Proj.4 library. The other way is
to use the EPSG codes. These codes are standard projection codes (or spatial 
reference identifiers) as defined by the European Petroleum Survey Group
(EPSG). In the case of our Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection, it has a 
code of "2163". If you comment out the four lines after PROJECTION and uncomment
the line "init=epsg:2163", this will provide the same information to Proj.4. If
you want to learn more about EPSG codes, have a look at
"/usr/local/share/proj/epsg" or "C:/proj/nad/epsg" ("/ms4w/proj/nad" in MS4W).
