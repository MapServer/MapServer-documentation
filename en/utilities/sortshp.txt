Purpose
--------

Sorts an Esri shapefile based on a single column in ascending or
descending order.  Supports INTEGER, DOUBLE and STRING column
types. Useful for prioritizing shapes for rendering and/or labeling.

Description
-----------

The idea here is that if you know that you need to display a certain
attribute classed by a certain value, it will be faster for
MapServer to access that value if it is at the beginning of the
attribute file.
  
Syntax
------

::
  
   sortshp [infile] [outfile] [item] [ascending|descending]

Example
-------

This example uses a roads file (`roads_ugl`) that has a field with
road classes in integer format (`class1`).
  
::
  
   sortshp roads_ugl roads-sort class1 ascending
     
Result
------

A new shapefile named `roads-sort.shp` is created with shapes
sorted in ascending order, according to the values in the `class1`
field, as shown below.
