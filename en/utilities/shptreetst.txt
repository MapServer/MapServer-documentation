Purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Executes a spatial query on an existing spatial index (.qix), that was
created by the :ref:`shptree` utility.  This utility is useful to
understand how a search of a Shape data set and its *qix* index works.


Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    read entire file now at quad box rec 20 file pos 1084
    result of rectangle search was

Result
  The above output from the shptreetst command tells us that the
  existing *.qix* index is for a Shape data set that contains 48
  shapes; indeed the Shape data set used in this example, *esp.shp*,
  contains 48 polygons of Spain.  The command also tells us that *qix*
  file has a quadtree depth of 4.
  
  Most importantly, the resulting shape IDs (or feature IDs) that were
  contained in the bounding box that we passed in our example were
  returned at the bottom of the output: "8, 10, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42,
  46".  You can use a tool such as QGIS to view those feature IDs and
  check what shapes MapServer is querying when a user clicks within
  that bounding box.
