Purpose
-------

Sorts an Esri shapefile and its associated `qix` spatial index (that was created with 
the :ref:`shptree` utility). Useful for 'Cloud Optimized Shapefiles', to 
enable fast bounding box spatial filtering.

.. seealso::
    the :ref:`sortshp` utility
  
Description
-----------

The idea here is that the contents of the shapefile will be sorted in the 
same order in the `shp` file and sorted for its `qix` spatial index file as well.
  
Syntax
------

::
  
   coshp [infile] [outfile]

Example
-------

This example uses a countries shapefile (`countries.shp`) :
  
::
  
   coshp countries countries_sorted
   
.. tip::
    Do not specify an extension for the shapefiles in the command above, 
    as it could cause problems in the generated filenames.
     
Result
------

::
  
   Wrote 177 spatially sorted shapes into shapefile 'countries_sorted'
   
and the following filenames were generated:

::
  
     countries_sorted.qix
     countries_sorted.shp
     countries_sorted.dbf
     countries_sorted.shx

Therefore a new shapefile named `countries_sorted.shp` is created with shapes
sorted (and `qix` file sorted), as shown below.
