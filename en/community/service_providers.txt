Core Contributors
-----------------

Core Contributor organizations have MapServer Committers and/or PSC members
as part of their team and as such they are the closest to the core development
of the software and are usually the best to go to for support.

They are close enough to the architecture to know what is possible, and to
ensure that any improvement to be made to MapServer gets done in the right
way and will be included in future releases of the software.

They wrote the software that you use, so you can trust them to help you get
the most out of it.
