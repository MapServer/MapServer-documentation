Some of the development of MapServer is coordinated through IRC. This page
describes how you log on to chat, ask questions, and hack around with the
developers.

Server and Channel Information
===============================

:Server: irc.libera.chat
:Channel: #mapserver

.. :Logs: http://irclogs.geoapt.com/mapserver/

Why IRC?
========================

IRC is a primary medium where Open Source GIS hackers congregate, collaborate,
and hack. It makes it easy to communicate things like compilation issues,
where immediate, iterative feedback allows folks to make a lot of progress.
Something that might take days of heavily-quoted emails through a maillist
might only take fifteen minutes on IRC.

IRC is a great way to coordinate on-line meetings. The MapServer project steering
committee often uses IRC for their monthly meetings.

Some folks find IRC distracting and do not normally participate except for
on-line meetings.

How do I join?
=========================

You can connect directly through your browser at https://web.libera.chat/#mapserver
(just enter a nickname).

There are many other IRC clients available. `This page
<https://libera.chat/guides/clients>`__ (and `here
<https://tiki.org/Connecting-To-IRC>`__) provides a good listing for many
different platforms.  If you are using `Thunderbird <https://www.thunderbird.net>`__ 
as your email client, it has a great IRC chat option included.
