Matrix/IRC
*****************************************************************************

Some of the development of MapServer is coordinated through Matrix (or through the IRC 
bridge). This page describes how you log on to chat, ask questions, and hack around 
with the developers.

.. tip::
    The IRC<-->Matrix bridge was created on 2024-07-03, to allow seamless communication
    between both methods (meaning: if you still prefer IRC, you can chat in the 
    **#mapserver** IRC room and your messages will be automatically shared in 
    Matrix's **#mapserver:osgeo.org** room.

Why Matrix/IRC Chat?
====================

IRC was for a long time the primary medium where Open Source GIS hackers 
congregate, collaborate, and hack; since around 2019, Matrix has made it easier
to connect to chats on multiple platforms (smart phones, operating systems) seamlessly. 
The bridge between the MapServer rooms in Matrix and IRC has made it easy 
for developers and users of the MapServer community to discuss instantly in a public 
forum.

Matrix/IRC is also great way to coordinate on-line meetings. The MapServer 
:ref:`Project Steering Committee <psc>` often uses Matrix/IRC for their monthly 
meetings.
